In addition to this high-quality technology, the IQ-X also has design: the housing, which also serves as a cooling system, is made of high-quality aluminium, available in silver or black. Slits in the mounting ring radiate brightly to the side, providing accents which also improve visibility, while the ergonomic operating button is embedded in a blue illuminated ring. This safety equipment is equipped as standard: a sensor-controlled daytime running light, standing light and a flexible multi-joint front light mount with an integrated cable duct, which also allows overhead installation. Information on the return and disposal of used batteries and electrical equipment can be found here . a flexible multi-joint headlamp holder with an integrated cable ductLED dynamo front lightsergonomic control buttonshigh-quality aluminium housingwith a switch for a hub dynamo IQ Technology The revolutionary light from busch+müller: a special reflector with an optimised cooling system uses a high-performance LED as an indirect light source. The LED is not visible any longer in the middle of the reflector. This creates a light field that is extremely evenly illuminated and can be twice as wide as conventional technology. Light effects can be positioned more precisely - for example, the near field in front of the front wheel can be additionally brightened. By the way: The standing light of the Lumotec headlights can run for many minutes. This is why the standing lights on Lumotec IQ models can also be switched off manually - so that no thief is tempted when the bicycle is parked. Automatic Sensor If a Lumotec front light has the addition of "" sensor"" in its name, it can switch on automatically at dusk or in the dark, and switches off automatically when driving in the light.

These are shifting aids and specially shaped sprocket teeth that make shifting to larger or smaller sprockets suppler, smoother and quieter. The system of small rivets attached to the side of the sprocket and milled or pressed-in ramps ensures that the chain is already carried along by the next sprocket during the shifting process before it leaves the previous sprocket. Hyperglide+ is optimised for faster shifting and shifting under load and has a more efficient chain connection, holding power and power transfer when combined with a compatible HG chain. Compared to Hyperglide, the shifting time is reduced by one third and the pedal stroke is noticeably reduced. HG+ enables a completely new chain stability and thus offers a safe riding experience. Micro Spline Micro Spline is an innovative tooth profile on MTB freehub bodies from Shimano. All Shimano 12-speed MTB cassettes with a 10-tooth sprocket are equipped with Micro Spline freehub toothing. The significantly higher and finer toothing enables a stiffer connection between the cassette and the hub body.

In contrast to the CS-R7100, it's compatible with both electronic and mechanical groupsets. With only about 15 grams more weight than the Ultegra model, it offers fast and smooth shifting, even when you pedal hard. It has the same width as an 11-speed cassette, so the sprockets are closer together. This accommodates the speed and smoothness of shifting. The smallest of the 12 steel sprockets has 11 teeth and the largest 34, which means a very wide range that lets you find the right gear uphill, downhill and on flat terrain. This way you can move forward efficiently everywhere and maintain your flow. Also worth noting: the freehub of the CS-R7101 cassette is not only compatible with Shimano 12-speed freehub bodies, but also with conventional road freehub bodies. fast and smooth gear changes even at high torquessame width as 11-speed cassette due to closer-spaced sprocketswide range for any terraincompatible with 12-speed and 11-speed road freehub bodiessuitable for electronic and mechanical groupsetsnickel-plated sprocket and lockringanodised spider HG cassette Shimano Hyperglide cassettes (HG cassettes) have strategically-positioned ramps and special tooth profiles so that the chain can be completely guided directly onto the next sprocket.

A completely new system to discover new horizons. This is Eagle. There is still much to discover. Designed to SRAM Eagle geometry, the GX Eagle chain features full pins, Eagle PowerLock® and offers smooth, efficient shifting you can rely on every ride. Before you replace components on your e-bike, please read through the guidelines for component replacement for CE-marked E-bikes/pedelecs with pedal assistance. Flow Link™: The ultra smooth inner plates of the chain are completely edge-free. This reduces friction on the cassette and chainring. The result: low-noise performance and longer component life. The chain design allows for a narrower profile. This way, the chain is much more torsion resistant. Due to their smooth outer flaps, the riveting is more uniform and the tensile strength is higher. PowerLock®: SRAM chain engineers developed PowerLock® as a tool-free, secure and consistent way to connect SRAM chains.

Eagle drivetrains chrome-plated inner plates with PVD coatingnickel-plated outer plates with PVD coatingFlow Link and Hard Chrome™ technologies for less wearcolour matching Eagle componentsquiet, light and durablestrong PowerLock master link Flow Link™: The ultra smooth inner plates of the chain are completely edge-free. This reduces friction on the cassette and chainring. The result: low-noise performance and longer component life. The chain design allows for a narrower profile. This way, the chain is much more torsion resistant. Due to their smooth outer flaps, the riveting is more uniform and the tensile strength is higher. Hard Chrome™: Chains with Hard Chrome have a four times higher (wear) resistance than other SRAM chains. This is due to the machining process for the inner links and rollers. The push-pin resistance and the overall resistance correspond to current SRAM chains. Chains with Hard Chrome last longer and are extremely stable. PowerLock™ SRAM have developed PowerLock as a tool-free, safe and consistent way to connect SRAM chains. Although the PowerLock master link does not require any special tools for assembly, each PowerLock can only be used once due to the narrow tolerance range of modern drivetrains. X-Sync™: Chains with X-Sync technology are perfectly matched for use with X-Sync chainrings. X-Sync chainrings by SRAM provide the highest performance and durability. The long X-Sync tooth edges grip the chain earlier than traditional triangular teeth. The sharp and narrow tooth profile and the rounded sloping edges support chain guiding: To provide the best possible performance even on muddy terrain, the X-Sync chainrings have indentations for the inner chain links and rollers to remove dirt and mud.

The goal was a chainring that increases the performance of the Eagle groupset under all operating conditions. The result: the chainring teeth are longer and shaped like a saw blade to perfectly engage the Eagle chain. The new chainring thus increases chain tension and efficiency when pedalling.

The goal was a chainring that increases the performance of the Eagle groupset under all operating conditions. The result: the chainring teeth are longer and shaped like a saw blade to perfectly engage the Eagle chain. The new chainring thus increases chain tension and efficiency when pedalling. At the same time, friction, chain noise and wear are reduced. In addition, with the "" polar grey"" variant, a chainring version in the new AXS design is now also available.

Test riders around the world have confirmed that this design brings unparalleled performance. The right side of the chainring tooth has a different shape than the left side. The right side transmits the power to the chain and the left side opens a free space for cleaning mud and dirt. Since the two sides have completely different functions, it makes sense to design them differently, true to the motto: extra reinforcement where you need it, less material where you don't. The right side of the Drop-Stop tooth is as wide as possible to distribute the load over a larger area, which also minimises wear. The left side of the Drop-Stop tooth helps to guide the chain, but it does not transmit any load. Therefore the left side is narrower than the chain roller. Wear is not an issue on this side, so Wolf Tooth was able to save material and create a better mud clearance channel.

ABEC 3 bearings from Enduro Bearings feature 10th-degree chrome steel balls that are twice as round as the industry standard, and manufactured to the highest standard. The treads are made of a 52100 carbon chrome steel alloy that is vacuum-generated and then hardened for extra strength and durability. A high-gloss polish ensures precision and low noise. MAX bearings are characterised by a 35 to 40 % higher load capacity than standard radial bearings. For 20 years Enduro Bearings has been manufacturing them specifically for use on mountain bike shocks. As its name indicates, MAX bearings are fitted with the maximum possible number of balls. The grooves in the races are deeper to accommodate the multiple lateral turning forces at the MTB rear pivot. MAX BO (Black Oxide) bearings receive an additional magnetite treatment and therefore have almost as high a corrosion resistance as stainless steel. The inner edge, which is wider than the outer edge, is characteristic of MAX-E bearings. This makes it possible to do without spacers. The stainless steel bearings from Enduro Bearings are based on bearing balls and running surfaces made of 440C stainless steel. This material ensures maximum corrosion resistance in critical applications and environments. Stainless steel has 20% less load capacity than the 52100 chrome steel alloy used in most other Enduro Bearings, but it is far superior in terms of rust resistance. Seals and CRC marine grease provide additional water resistance. If you live in a rainy area and/or you don't leave your bike in the rain, 440C stainless steel bearings are for you. They can also be useful for headsets, as drops of sweat may be a problem there.

This gives you access to information about your overall performance, cadence, torque efficiency, left-right balance and round pedalling. The accuracy of the total of 24 strain gauges is even higher than the previous model, with a deviation of only 1.5%. Thanks to Bluetooth and ANT+ radio protocol, there is broad compatibility with bike computers and similar devices. The lithium-ion battery is located in control unit on the crank spider, which you can easily recharge yourself. If it is completely full again after about 2.5 hours, it will last for at least 300 hours. By the way, the charging cable is the same as for your Dura-Ace Di2 shifter. You can also carry out firmware updates via the E-Tube Project. On the housing of the control unit, you will find an LED that signals the battery charge level and a button for easy zero calibration. Of course, the entire construction is waterproof and there is active temperature compensation, so you don't have to worry about the weather. You can attach the magnet for cadence measurement to the chainstay, seat tube or down tube using the included positioning tool. Apart from these special features, the FC-R9200-P is technically identical to the "" normal"" Dura-Ace crank. It converts your power into propulsion in a highly efficient manner, is characterised by an optimal stability/weight ratio thanks to the Hollowtech II design and inspires with precise, fast shifting processes. The crank arms are hollow-formed, which results in a significant weight saving. Except for the axle, all essential parts were made of lightweight metal. FC-R9200-P has an asymmetrical 4-arm bolt circle diameter of 110 mm. It produces a chainline of 44.5 mm and has a Q-factor of 148 mm.

It is based on an integration of the bottom bracket and the right crank arm and works with a 24 mm axle or bearing diameter, which has proven to be optimal in terms of stability. In many cases, the bearing cups are on the outside so that the load is better distributed. High-quality precision seals ensure a long service life. Second-Generation Power Meters Shimano second-generation power meters use an improved force vector analysis and are therefore more accurate than their predecessors. Both crank arms have 12 sensors each, which are mounted in such a way that the crank deformation can be compensated for and the acting forces can be identified. The right and left sides are connected via the battery located in the axle, ensuring accurate measurement on both sides. The built-in temperature compensation contributes to the precision. You can easily recharge the battery with the Di2 charging cable EW-EC300. The power meters have Bluetooth and ANT+ compatibility to communicate with bike computers and smartphones.

Due to the same component basis (screw connection), existing hubs can be retrofitted or converted with this splined system. When converting from screw-on to plug-in sprockets, please also order the Splined Carrier or, in special cases, Splined Carrier S. Rohloff offers a template to check for collisions between the frame strut and the sprocket. When using the plug-in sprocket system, the chain tensioner requires the long frame bolt . The use of a closed chain guard (Hebie etc.) must be checked individually for compatibility. Due to the extended number of teeth, many chainring / sprocket combinations are possible. The permissible or desired transmission ratio can be determined with the Gears-Meters Table . In practice, a gear ratio (chainring: sprocket) of 2.5 - 2.8 has been proven to be suitable for touring/everyday use.

You love to escape from the stress and hectic goings-on of daily life. It's good that the Rohloff gears on your bike support you in this. This is because the Speedhub gearbox makes cycling very easy. Don't worry about whether the right gear is engaged, just turn the gear lever - even when stationary. With a twist, you can shift into any of the 14 gears. In addition, the Speedhub is extremely low-maintenance. Experience gears that requires minimal maintenance. One quick oil change a year, that's all it takes. After that, it's just a matter of keeping an eye on the chain, chainring and rear sprocket. No comparison to conventional multiple derailleurs and their sensitive rear derailleurs. Rohloff wants you to ride, not wait. The legendary Rohloff quality also includes the price-performance ratio of the gearbox. It is amazingly durable and also incurs minimal costs for its functionality. Enjoy an investment that pays off; because with every kilometre ridden, the cost balance improves compared to all other current derailleurs. The Speedhub is so robust that it has even been certified to run more than 300,000 kilometres. One of the most important reasons why the best touring cyclists in the world swear by the Speedhub. There is hardly a spot on earth, no matter how exotic, where the Rohloff gear hub has not been seen. Thanks to the Rohloff modular system, many different hub variants are created.

PowerGlide II: A cassette technology developed for off-road riding. More reliable, more durable and more powerful - SRAM cassettes are optimised by their tooth profile and climbing aids for precise and smooth gear changes. That way you can climb every mountain effortlessly. Flow Link™: The ultra smooth inner plates of the chain are completely edge-free. This reduces friction on the cassette and chainring. The result: low-noise performance and longer component life. The chain design allows for a narrower profile. This way, the chain is much more torsion resistant. Due to their smooth outer flaps, the riveting is more uniform and the tensile strength is higher. Hard Chrome™: Chains with Hard Chrome have a four times higher (wear) resistance than other SRAM chains. This is due to the machining process for the inner links and rollers. The push-pin resistance and the overall resistance correspond to current SRAM chains. Chains with Hard Chrome last longer and are extremely stable. PowerLock™: SRAM have developed PowerLock as a tool-free, safe and consistent way to connect SRAM chains. Although the PowerLock master link does not require any special tools for assembly, each PowerLock can only be used once due to the narrow tolerance range of modern drivetrains.

X-Dome™: X-Dome technology creates an incredibly lightweight, accurate and durable cassette. The open design repels dirt better and gives you smoother switching performance and longer component life. X-Glide 2™: The X-Glide 2 is the next generation of X-Glide technology. It has been specially optimised for the Eagle 12-speed cassette - for fast and precise shifting performance in all gears. X-Glide technology increases chain tension on the larger sprockets. Flow Link™: The ultra smooth inner plates of the chain are completely edge-free. This reduces friction on the cassette and chainring. The result: low-noise performance and longer component life. The chain design allows for a narrower profile. This way, the chain is much more torsion resistant. Due to their smooth outer flaps, the riveting is more uniform and the tensile strength is higher. Hard Chrome™: Chains with Hard Chrome have a four times higher (wear) resistance than other SRAM chains. This is due to the machining process for the inner links and rollers. The push-pin resistance and the overall resistance correspond to current SRAM chains. Chains with Hard Chrome last longer and are extremely stable. PowerLock™: SRAM have developed PowerLock as a tool-free, safe and consistent way to connect SRAM chains. Although the PowerLock master link does not require any special tools for assembly, each PowerLock can only be used once due to the narrow tolerance range of modern drivetrains. X-Sync™: Chains with X-Sync technology are perfectly matched for use with X-Sync chainrings. X-Sync chainrings by SRAM provide the highest performance and durability. The long X-Sync tooth edges grip the chain earlier than traditional triangular teeth. The sharp and narrow tooth profile and the rounded sloping edges support chain guiding: To provide the best possible performance even on muddy terrain, the X-Sync chainrings have indentations for the inner chain links and rollers to remove dirt and mud.

These are characterised by Hyperglide+ technology, which ensures seamless shifting even under heavy load. You can even change gears safely and instantly when pedalling or sprinting. The gradations have been selected to ensure high gear efficiency in all situations as well as optimal acceleration. The enlarged teeth of the pinions also contribute to this. A special plus point is its compatibility: CS-R9200 not only fits on the new 12-speed freehub body, but can also be used with conventional Shimano road freehub bodies. Depending on the gradation, five or six sprockets are made of titanium, resulting in a clear weight advantage. The Shimano CN-M9100 chain has already been put through its paces in the MTB sector and is also a central component of the Dura-Ace R9200 groupset. It has enlarged inner links and thus contributes significantly to smooth shifting performance. Thanks to HG technology, vibrations are avoided, chain hold is improved and pedalling efficiency is increased. The SIL-TEC coating of the outer plates and rollers ensures smoother, low-wear running.

The sprocket carrier made of aluminium and the nine sprockets made of steel impress with perfect stiffness. Nevertheless, the cassette is so light that it does not become noticeable as annoying dead weight on long tours. Those who prefer shorter distances will also be able to benefit from the CS-M770, because Shimano has designed its XT series for the needs of different types of riders. The blasted chrome finish provides a certain shiny effect. Of course, this cassette also features the Hyperglide (HG) sprocket design, which helps to move the chain smoothly and optimally from one sprocket to the other. The Shimano CN-HG93 9-speed chain is super slim, manufactured with high precision and glides smoothly from one tooth to the other thanks to Hyperglide (HG) technology.

You can choose between different colour combinations. The SRAM XG-1299 cassette with 12 gears for XX1 Eagle has a special, extremel durable finish and is light, stable and durable. With the different colour options, aesthetes who want to perfectly match the colour of their bike will also get their money's worth. Its X-Dome™ construction makes it extremely torsion-resistant, while the shifting process is quiet and smooth. With a possible 10-52 teeth, the XG-1299 has an enormous range for you, with which you don't have to step off the bike, even in the steepest climbs. Or would you like to switch to a larger chainring and reach higher speeds without sacrificing climbing ability? You have all the options! The SRAM PC XX1 chain is made for Eagle 12-speed drives and stands out on your mountain bike with a light, durable design and different color options. Hollow pins make the chain light, while Flow Link™ technology with smooth, flat link plates ensures precise, smooth shifting and silent operation. The chain is uncompromisingly strong without any loss of performance and extremely wear-resistant. Even aesthetes get their money's worth thanks to the colour selection matched to Eagle components.

X-Dome™: X-Dome technology creates an incredibly lightweight, accurate and durable cassette. The open design repels dirt better and gives you smoother switching performance and longer component life. X-Glide 2™: The X-Glide 2 is the next generation of X-Glide technology. It has been specially optimised for the Eagle 12-speed cassette - for fast and precise shifting performance in all gears. X-Glide technology increases chain tension on the larger sprockets. Flow Link™: The ultra smooth inner plates of the chain are completely edge-free. This reduces friction on the cassette and chainring. The result: low-noise performance and longer component life. The chain design allows for a narrower profile. This way, the chain is much more torsion resistant. Due to their smooth outer flaps, the riveting is more uniform and the tensile strength is higher. Hard Chrome™: Chains with Hard Chrome have a four times higher (wear) resistance than other SRAM chains. This is due to the machining process for the inner links and rollers. The push-pin resistance and the overall resistance correspond to current SRAM chains. Chains with Hard Chrome last longer and are extremely stable. PowerLock™ SRAM have developed PowerLock as a tool-free, safe and consistent way to connect SRAM chains. Although the PowerLock master link does not require any special tools for assembly, each PowerLock can only be used once due to the narrow tolerance range of modern drivetrains. X-Sync™: Chains with X-Sync technology are perfectly matched for use with X-Sync chainrings. X-Sync chainrings by SRAM provide the highest performance and durability. The long X-Sync tooth edges grip the chain earlier than traditional triangular teeth. The sharp and narrow tooth profile and the rounded sloping edges support chain guiding: To provide the best possible performance even on muddy terrain, the X-Sync chainrings have indentations for the inner chain links and rollers to remove dirt and mud. 10-50: 10-52: 1 x SRAM XG-1299 cassette1 x SRAM PC XX1 Eagle chain1 x SRAM PowerLock master link","{""Application"": ""Cross Country, All Mountain"", ""Gearing"": ""12-speed"", ""Freehub Compatibility"": ""SRAM XD"", ""Series"": ""XX1 Eagle"", ""Sprocket Material"": ""steel (sprockets 1 - 11), aluminium (sprocket 12)"", ""Gradation"": ""10-12-14-16-18-21-24-28-32-36-42-52 T"", ""Number of Links"": ""126"", ""Closure Type"": ""PowerLock™ FlowLink™"", ""Pin Type"": ""hollow pins"", ""Directional"": ""no (chain), yes (master link)"", ""Material"": ""steel"", ""rainbow"": ""coloured"", ""copper"": ""copper red"", ""Manufacturer Numbers"": ""00.2418.107.002 (rainbow), 00.2418.107.000 (copper), 00.2418.107.001 (gold) + 00.2518.039.010 (XX1 rainbow), 00.2518.043.010 (XX1 copper), 00.2518.024.020 (XX1 gold), 00.2518.024.021 (XX1 black)""}",2025-12-25 15:44:33,2025-12-27 13:41:51

Due to its robustness, it is also suited for e-bikes. The smallest sprockets are manufactured in one piece as a mini cluster, the remaining sprockets are assembled in a pindome design. Compared to Eagle cassettes, the gear gradation of the largest sprockets is more even. The X-Sync design enables outstanding shifting performance even and especially under full load. Thanks to cassette mapping, the gear changes take place along designated shift ramps, which makes the process extremely smooth. With a chainline of 55 mm, the lower chain angle is noticeable, which reduces wear and increases precision. The cassette can only be used together with an Eagle Transmission rear derailleur, with which it opens up an ideal shifting experience. As an assembly aid, the setup sprocket that you need for the correct adjustment of the rear derailleur is highlighted in colour. Before you replace components on your e-bike, please read through the guidelines for component replacement for CE-marked e-bikes/pedelecs with pedal assistance. only compatible withEagle Transmission rear derailleurs robust, inexpensive 12-speed cassette for an electronic mountain bike drivetrainlargest sprocket made of aluminium, others made of steelsmallest sprockets as one-piece mini cluster, others in pindome designexcellent shifting performance under full load thanks to X-Sync designmore consistent gear sequence than Eagle with regard to the largest three sprocketsin conjunction with 55 mm chainline, more moderate chain angle, thus higher resistance and precisionforms a functional unit with Eagle Transmission rear derailleursetup sprocket colour-coded for correct derailleur settingcassette mapping for smooth shifting along designated shift rampsalso suitable for e-bikes MINI CLUSTER™ MINI CLUSTER refers to a hybrid construction resulting in a light and strong cassette: The smallest sprockets are CNC-machined from a single block of steel, while the other sprockets are assembled with pins.

ABEC 3 bearings from Enduro Bearings feature 10th-degree chrome steel balls that are twice as round as the industry standard, and manufactured to the highest standard. The treads are made of a 52100 carbon chrome steel alloy that is vacuum-generated and then hardened for extra strength and durability. A high-gloss polish ensures precision and low noise. MAX bearings are characterised by a 35 to 40 % higher load capacity than standard radial bearings. For 20 years Enduro Bearings has been manufacturing them specifically for use on mountain bike shocks. As its name indicates, MAX bearings are fitted with the maximum possible number of balls. The grooves in the races are deeper to accommodate the multiple lateral turning forces at the MTB rear pivot. The stainless steel bearings from Enduro Bearings are based on bearing balls and running surfaces made of 440C stainless steel. This material ensures maximum corrosion resistance in critical applications and environments. Stainless steel has 20% less load capacity than the 52100 chrome steel alloy used in most other Enduro Bearings, but it is far superior in terms of rust resistance. Seals and CRC marine grease provide additional water resistance. If you live in a rainy area and/or you don't leave your bike in the rain, 440C stainless steel bearings are for you.

As with the top component series, the Hyperglide+ shifting aid construction ensures particularly smooth and quiet gear changes, even under load. The largest sprocket has 51 teeth, the smallest only 10, so this cassette is only compatible with Shimano Micro-Spline freehubs. 12-speed Micro Spline: 12-speed Hyperglide+ cassette for fast, smooth gear changes, even under heavy loadfor 1x12-speed10 T sprocket as smallest sprocket, possible due to new freehub construction (Micro Spline)light, stiff Beam-Spider constructionplated sprocket and lockring, painted spider Hyperglide+ / HG+ Hyperglide+ is the efficient further development of the Hyperglide system by Shimano. These are shifting aids and specially shaped sprocket teeth that make shifting to larger or smaller sprockets suppler, smoother and quieter. The system of small rivets attached to the side of the sprocket and milled or pressed-in ramps ensures that the chain is already carried along by the next sprocket during the shifting process before it leaves the previous sprocket. Hyperglide+ is optimised for faster shifting and shifting under load and has a more efficient chain connection, holding power and power transfer when combined with a compatible HG chain. Compared to Hyperglide, the shifting time is reduced by one third and the pedal stroke is noticeably reduced. HG+ enables a completely new chain stability and thus offers a safe riding experience. Micro Spline Micro Spline is an innovative tooth profile on MTB freehub bodies from Shimano. All Shimano 12-speed MTB cassettes with a 10-tooth sprocket are equipped with Micro Spline freehub toothing. The significantly higher and finer toothing enables a stiffer connection between the cassette and the hub body. The resulting increased contact area ensures reliable power transmission, minimises wear and prevents deformation of the freehub and sprocket. 10-51: 1 x Shimano Deore CS-M6100-12 cassette1 x Shimano steel lockring","{""Application"": ""All Mountain, Cross Country, Enduro"", ""Gearing"": ""12-speed"", ""Gradation"": ""10-12-14-16-18-21-24-28-33-39-45-51 t"", ""Sprocket Material"": ""steel"", ""Freehub Compatibility"": ""Shimano Micro Spline"", ""Series"": ""Deore M6100"", ""Spider"": ""1 (aluminium)"", ""Recommended Chain"": ""HG 12-speed (e.g. CN-M6100 )"", ""Shifter"": ""SL-M9100, SL-M8100, SL-M7100, SL-M6100, SW-M8150, ST-RX820, ST-RX610"", ""Rear Derailleur"": ""RD-M9100-SGS, RD-M8100-SGS, RD-M7100-SGS, RD-M6100-SGS, RD-M8150-12, RD-RX822-SGS (all 1x12-speed)"", ""Chain"": ""CN-M9100, CN-M8100, CN-M7100, CN-M6100"", ""Manufacturer Number"": ""I-CSM610012051""}",2025-12-29 16:11:25,2025-12-29 16:11:25

Campagnolo has achieved this: the shaping of the teeth optimises the speed and smoothness of the chain passage during shifting. With this tooth shape, the stresses acting on the chain are reduced so that it rises faster onto the larger chainrings. The larger sprockets are grouped in threes and mounted on a newly developed aluminium carrier frame. This increases the stiffness by 180 % and the individual sprockets are 70 % more torsionally stiff.

This is necessary for optimal performance. The OT-RS900 should be cut from the correct side when adjusting the length. One of the two ends is flare-processed. This flare-processed end is inserted into the barrel adjuster of the rear derailleur and should therefore remain there. OT-RS900 For Dura-Ace, Ultegra, 105, GRX and other 11-speed or 12-speed road and gravel rear derailleurs, Shimano has developed the special OT-RS900 cable housing. It is less stiff than the conventional OT-SP41 housing and is therefore better suited to the tight curve where the cable is routed from the frame to the rear derailleur. Thanks to OT-RS900, problems with the barrel adjuster can be prevented and the rear wheel can be removed more easily.

These are a flat-mount brake calipers for front or rear and an electronic shift/brake lever that enables wireless 2x or 12-speed shifting and hydraulic braking. The set includes organic brake pads, which contribute to improved heat dissipation with their Ice Tech cooling fins, a brake hose as well as connection material. The 105 R7170 disc brake caliper has 10% more brake pad clearance than its predecessor model. This minimises the likelihood of grinding noises and thus results in a quieter braking process. The powerful, excellently controllable braking power ensures reliable deceleration and brings you to a safe stop in all conditions. You also benefit from the user-friendly bleeding process, also known as One-Way Bleeding. With its flat mount design, the two-piece aluminium brake caliper also blends in perfectly with the overall appearance of your bike. By the way, the R7170 does not weigh more than the comparable Ultegra model. The 105 ST-R7170 Di2 shift/brake lever has an upwardly extended grip bar end which offers a very ergonomic hold. In addition, you can easily adjust the grip width to your hand size with the help of a 2 mm hex tool. Thanks to the increased braking range and the sensitive lever action, you have full control over all braking processes, and the pressure point is also adjustable. At the same time, the shift/brake levers weigh only about 30 grams per pair more than the Ultegra model. Of course, as before with Dura-Ace and Ultegra, the retreaded Di2 platform is used. This means that the ST-R7170 communicates via a wireless protocol with the rear derailleur, which in turn is wired to the battery and indirectly to the front derailleur. This not only means lightning-fast, highly precise gear changes at the touch of a button. By dispensing with cables on the cockpit, your bike looks tidier, assembly is easier and the shifters & derailleurs are insensitive to dirt at this point. The STI is powered by two button cells that last for several years and can be self-replaced when needed. The brake lever is made of lightweight aluminium, the grip body is made of durable composite material. Information on the return and disposal of batteries and electrical equipment can be found here .

By refining the technology, it became possible to make shifting so smooth at the front and rear that they can be triggered with just one finger. Shimano calls such levers Dual Control Levers (DCL). Digital Integrated Intelligence (Di2) Di2 systems are the electronic shifting systems from Shimano. They are based on the SEIS, the Shimano Electronic Intelligent System, which takes over the index shifting function from the mechanical components, only via power cables or radio signals and not via a Bowden cable. Shifting is done by simply pressing a button. This has the advantage that no great effort is required, your concentration on the ride is not disturbed and operation is easy even with cold hands. In addition, the electronic gear changes are very fast and highly precise. There is also no risk of a defective circuit due to dirty cables or other problems. You can adjust individual settings via the E-Tube Project, such as adjusting the shifting speed, the number of shifting operations per button press or the Synchro or Semi-Synchro shifting function. Shimano offers an app for this purpose. Gear maintenance and firmware updates are also done via E-Tube, with the bike connected to a PC running the appropriate E-Tube software for more extensive workshop work. Semi-wireless The Shimano Di2 12-speed road groupsets in the disc brake version work semi-wirelessly: at the crucial point, namely the interaction between STIs and rear derailleur, the cable is dispensed with, which makes for a tidy cockpit and considerably simplifies assembly. The wireless protocol is extremely fast and reliable, so that the shifting speed reaches a new level - with consistently high precision. Attention was also paid to keeping power consumption as low as possible. Cables are only used between the battery and the rear derailleur and between the battery and the front derailleur. These are thinner than the previous models and easier to lay. Shimano relies on a central battery located in the seatpost. This increases safety and ensures an uncomplicated charging process via the rear derailleur. Once fully charged, the circuit can be ridden for approx. 1000 km.

Digital Integrated Intelligence (Di2) Di2 systems are the electronic shifting systems from Shimano. They are based on the SEIS, the Shimano Electronic Intelligent System, which takes over the index shifting function from the mechanical components, only via power cables or radio signals and not via a Bowden cable. Shifting is done by simply pressing a button. This has the advantage that no great effort is required, your concentration on the ride is not disturbed and operation is easy even with cold hands. In addition, the electronic gear changes are very fast and highly precise. There is also no risk of a defective circuit due to dirty cables or other problems. You can adjust individual settings via the E-Tube Project, such as adjusting the shifting speed, the number of shifting operations per button press or the Synchro or Semi-Synchro shifting function. Shimano offers an app for this purpose. Gear maintenance and firmware updates are also done via E-Tube, with the bike connected to a PC running the appropriate E-Tube software for more extensive workshop work. 2-speed: 11-speed: 1 x Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 ST-R9180 shift/brake lever1 x Shimano 85 mm power cable1 x Shimano TL-EW02 plug tool (11-speed version only)","{""Series"": ""Dura-Ace Di2 R9150"", ""Application"": ""Triathlon & Time Trial"", ""Gearing"": ""2-speed, 11-/12-speed"", ""Shifting System"": ""electronic"", ""Brake Type"": ""hydraulic"", ""Brake Lever Material"": ""carbon (CFRP)"", ""Lever Body Material"": ""aluminium"", ""Mount"": ""right"", ""Handlebar Inner Diameter"": ""19.0 - 22.5 mm"", ""Reach Adjust"": ""bolt"", ""Adjustment Options"": ""Reach Adjust"", ""Outer Handlebar Diameter"": ""22.2 - 24.0 mm"", ""Power Cable"": ""EW-SD50 (1 x connection)"", ""Actuation"": ""mineral oil"", ""Brake Caliper"": ""BR-R9170 recommended, also compatible with BR-R9270, BR-R8170, BR-R8070, BR-R7170, BR-R7070, BR-RS785, BR-RX820, BR-RX820-LE, BR-RX810, BR-RX400, BR-4770"", ""Brake Hose"": ""SM-BH90-JK-SS"", ""Satellite Shifter"": ""SW-R9150, SW-R9160"", ""Additional Brake Lever"": ""BL-RX812"", ""Manufacturer Number"": ""I-STR9180R""}",2025-12-29 16:16:06,2025-12-29 16:16:06

The set includes organic brake pads, which contribute to improved heat dissipation with their Ice Tech cooling fins, two brake hoses and connection material. The 105 R7170 disc brake calipers have 10% more brake pad clearance than their predecessor models. This minimises the likelihood of grinding noises and thus results in a quieter braking process. The powerful, excellently controllable braking power ensures reliable deceleration and brings you to a safe stop in all conditions. You also benefit from the user-friendly bleeding process, also known as One-Way Bleeding. With their flat mount design, the two-piece aluminium brake callipers also blend in perfectly with the overall appearance of your bike. By the way, the R7170s do not weigh more than the comparable Ultegra model. The 105 ST-R7170 Di2 shift/brake levers have extended bar end grips at the top for a very ergonomic hold. In addition, you can easily adjust the grip width to your hand size with the help of a 2 mm hex tool. Thanks to the increased braking range and the sensitive lever action, you have full control over all braking processes, and the pressure point is also adjustable. At the same time, the shift/brake levers weigh only about 30 grams per pair more than the Ultegra model. Of course, as before with Dura-Ace and Ultegra, the retreaded Di2 platform is used. This means that the ST-R7170 communicate via a wireless protocol with the rear derailleur, which in turn is wired to the battery and indirectly to the front derailleur. This not only means lightning-fast, highly precise gear changes at the touch of a button. By dispensing with cables on the cockpit, your bike also looks tidier, installation is easier and the shifters and derailleurs are insensitive to dirt at this point. The STIs are powered by button cells that last for several years and can be self-replaced when needed. The brake levers are made of lightweight aluminium, the grip bodies are made of durable composite material. Information on the return and disposal of batteries and electrical equipment can be found here .

By refining the technology, it became possible to make shifting so smooth at the front and rear that they can be triggered with just one finger. Shimano calls such levers Dual Control Levers (DCL). Digital Integrated Intelligence (Di2) Di2 systems are the electronic shifting systems from Shimano. They are based on the SEIS, the Shimano Electronic Intelligent System, which takes over the index shifting function from the mechanical components, only via power cables or radio signals and not via a Bowden cable. Shifting is done by simply pressing a button. This has the advantage that no great effort is required, your concentration on the ride is not disturbed and operation is easy even with cold hands. In addition, the electronic gear changes are very fast and highly precise. There is also no risk of a defective circuit due to dirty cables or other problems. You can adjust individual settings via the E-Tube Project, such as adjusting the shifting speed, the number of shifting operations per button press or the Synchro or Semi-Synchro shifting function. Shimano offers an app for this purpose. Gear maintenance and firmware updates are also done via E-Tube, with the bike connected to a PC running the appropriate E-Tube software for more extensive workshop work. Semi-wireless The Shimano Di2 12-speed road groupsets in the disc brake version work semi-wirelessly: at the crucial point, namely the interaction between STIs and rear derailleur, the cable is dispensed with, which makes for a tidy cockpit and considerably simplifies assembly. The wireless protocol is extremely fast and reliable, so that the shifting speed reaches a new level - with consistently high precision. Attention was also paid to keeping power consumption as low as possible. Cables are only used between the battery and the rear derailleur and between the battery and the front derailleur. These are thinner than the previous models and easier to lay. Shimano relies on a central battery located in the seatpost. This increases safety and ensures an uncomplicated charging process via the rear derailleur. Once fully charged, the circuit can be ridden for approx. 1000 km. The components are paired together via the E-Tube platform. One Way Bleeding One Way Bleeding is a technique used on Shimano calipers that facilitates brake bleeding. The hose routing has been optimised so that no air bubbles remain in the brake calliper. In combination with the funnel, the brake can be bled cleanly and easily.

The floating design consists of two parts, an aluminium spider attached to the hub and the actual brake rotor made of stainless steel, which is in contact with the brake pads. When the disc heats up, it expands. However, since it is not rigidly connected to the Spider, but "" floating"" over riveted joints, it can expand and contract freely without exerting pressure on the Spider. This prevents distortion of the brake rotor. Another advantage of floating rotors is their lower weight compared to standard brake rotors. * Due to the design of the floating brake rotor, a collision between the rivets and the brake caliper can occur with brake calipers from other manufacturers.

This is achieved thanks to the patented Dovetail Interlink technology, a special interlocking of the outer and inner ring. This provides additional support on the inner ring in the event of thermal expansion of the outer ring. This means that the torque is not transmitted exclusively via the rivets, but over the entire surface, resulting in increased stiffness and direct heat dissipation under continuous load, as occurs in gravity applications. The 220 mm diameter version creates about 10% more braking power than a 203 mm model and 20% more than a 180 mm model. Critical temperatures for the lining are reached much later and the higher mass of the brake rotor reduces the risk of brake fading and reduces pad wear by 15%. The brake rotor is also optimised for e-bike use. Warning: Do not use brake rotor with center lock adapter!

The revised 14 mm master piston and the 100% reliable Magura Royal Blood mineral oil guarantee the strong braking power and best dosing in any operating conditions, for which Magura hydraulic rim brakes rightly receive top marks in series production. Thanks to the TPA (Turbo Pad Adjuster), brake pad wear can also be compensated for easily and without tools. But don't worry, ergonomics has not been neglected either. In the current MT disc brake series, the 3-finger brake lever scores in terms of ergonomics. In addition, the latest findings from the test winner were also incorporated. This includes the tool-free Reach Adjust in 3 steps. Finally, everything comes together with a little bit of high-tech: the brake levers and handlebar clamp are completely made of Carbotecture® and save 10 g per brake compared to the entry-level HS 11. Thanks to Easy-Bleed and the option to shorten the cable at the brake lever, the HS 22 is particularly easy to install. The Easy-Mount design guarantees even easier installation. Easy Mount: Anyone who has ever mounted or adjusted a Magura brake from the HS series knows how time-consuming it can be to get the piston between the clamp system in the correct position to the wheel. This is now made much easier by a slanted groove in the clamp. Simply loosen the upper screw and align it closer or further to the rim by turning the wing below the piston. Done!

Thanks to Ice Technologies, the system does not overheat and the braking performance remains constant even on the most difficult descents. One way bleeding also allows the calipers to be quickly and easily bled. On the brake lever side, the BL-M820-B scores with Servo Wave, a design for better modulation of the braking force, as well as with the I-Spec integration option of shift and brake levers.

During the braking process, the brake pads are guided quickly to the brake rotor with very short lever travel. The greater part of the lever travel is reserved for the actual braking force. In this way, you can apply your braking power in a more targeted manner and use it more effectively. I-Spec I-Spec enables the connection between the brake lever and shift lever on MTB derailleurs from Shimano. The main advantages are a cleaner look at the cockpit, more space on the handlebars and, of course, weight savings. One-Way Bleeding One Way Bleeding is a technique used on Shimano calipers that facilitates brake bleeding. The hose routing has been optimised so that no air bubbles remain in the brake calliper. In combination with the funnel, the brake can be bled cleanly and easily. J-Kit J-Kit is a simple line connection system for hydraulic brakes from Shimano, so that you can install your brakes quickly and easily. The brake hose does not come connected to the brake to facilitate routing of the hose in the frame. The brake hose is already filled with oil in the J-Kit and sealed with a thin membrane. There is a small pin in the J-Kit brake lever that pierces this diaphragm during assembly to allow oil to flow. I-Spec brake levers have a new mount as of 2014 (Version B). As of now, there is no compatibility to shifters with old I-Spec mounts.

It offers steel coil-like behaviour, but combines it with versatile adjustability. The RC2T damping allows you to tune the high- and low-speed compression and rebound. For quick adjustment while you're riding, use the 2-position lever to switch between Open and Firm. Thanks to the TouchDown technology, you get exactly the support you need in every travel section. The shock is also equipped with adjustable hydraulic bottom out as standard. Compared to the Super Deluxe Air, the Vivid has a larger air chamber and a stronger chassis, which results in more oil volume, i.e. better heat management, and more bushing overlap, i.e. lower friction.

You get a GX Eagle AXS rear derailleur with battery and charger, a matching GX Eagle AXS shifter with two programmable shift buttons and an adjustment gauge. The rear derailleur has a robust steel cage and shifts quickly and precisely even under load. With Overload Clutch, it stays protected in the event of hard hits. The Controller shifter has two control surfaces that you can access without loosening your grip on the handlebars. Both the rear derailleur and controller can be personalised using the AXS app, so you can set your preferred shifting behaviour. You can also read the battery level not only on the rear derailleur itself, but also in the app. Doesn't your bike look a lot tidier without shift cables? Information on the return and disposal of used batteries and electrical equipment can be found here . Before you replace components on your e-bike, please read through the guidelines for component replacement for CE-marked e-bikes/pedelecs with pedal assistance.

The SRAM AXS app allows you to view battery status, change component behaviour, adjust controls, receive maintenance reminders and update firmware. Overload Clutch: In case of an impact against the rear derailleur, the motor decouples to give the rear derailleur a maximum of movement and returns to its original position after the impact. Roller Bearing Clutch™: Rear derailleurs with Roller Bearing Clutch are equipped for rough and demanding terrain. Unimpressed by a ground full of roots, stones or rocks, the technology ensures a stable rear derailleur and prevents beating chains. The rear derailleur thus offers maximum drive stability without compromising on precision or performance. Cage Lock™: Thanks to the rear derailleur's Cage-Lock technology, the chain and the rear wheel can be fitted and removed really easily. Simply release the chain tension by pushing the shift cage forward and locking it. MatchMaker X Integrated: The MatchMaker-X clamp is more than just a clamp. It is a wonder of tidyness. With room for up to three controls on each clamp, you can mount everything from your XLoc damper lock, SRAM switches and Avid brake levers to the Reverb XLoc remote, all in just two clamps, so you have everything within reach. 1 x SRAM GX Eagle AXS rear derailleur1 x SRAM GX Eagle AXS Controller shifter1 x SRAM battery1 x SRAM battery cover1 x SRAM charger1 x USB cable for charger1 x SRAM chain gap adjustment gauge","{""Series"": ""GX Eagle AXS"", ""Application"": ""Cross Country, All Mountain, Enduro"", ""Shifters & Derailleurs"": ""12-speed (wireless)"", ""Mount"": ""clamp (closed), Matchmaker"", ""Cassette Teeth (max.)"": ""52-tooth"", ""Compatibility"": ""SRAM MTB 12-speed"", ""Derailleur Pulleys"": ""14-tooth"", ""Outer Cage Material"": ""steel"", ""Inner Cage Material"": ""steel"", ""Other Materials"": ""steel"", ""Type"": ""Controller"", ""Body Material"": ""composite"", ""Lever Material"": ""composite"", ""Clamp Diameter"": ""22.2 mm"", ""Adjustment Options"": ""individual key assignment for intuitive operation""}",2025-12-29 16:44:02,2025-12-29 16:44:02

You get two crank arms, a chainring, an electronically controlled rear derailleur with AXS controller, a cassette and a chain, all from the XX series for all-mountain trails and enduro race tracks. One of the special features of the Eagle Transmission is a derailleur hanger-free mounting of the electronic rear derailleur, which is mounted instead of the UDH universal derailleur hanger. The use of this groupset is therefore only possible on frames with this derailleur hanger. Direct mounting results in exact, tolerance-free alignment of the rear derailleur and an unprecedented harmony of rear derailleur and cassette. Adjustment bolts and limit screws are not required. In addition, the rear derailleur is designed to be extremely tough, so that it can easily withstand impacts from all sides and you can continue riding without any problems after a fall. Via the Magic Wheel, the lower derailleur pulley, the chain simply continues to run if a branch or something similar gets in the way. The AXS Pod Ultimate Controller can be mounted on the left or right side. The XS-1297 cassette has one aluminium and eleven steel sprockets and offers a wide range with 10-52 teeth, whose gear jumps have been optimised compared to Eagle cassettes. The X-SYNC design enables outstanding shifting performance even and especially under full load. Thanks to cassette mapping, the gear changes take place along designated shift ramps, which makes the process extremely smooth. The crank arms are made of carbon with a foam core and are therefore light and stiff. The 36-tooth chainring is precisely matched to T-type chains, as are the cassette sprockets and derailleur pulleys. The XX chain has a special flattop design reminiscent of road chains, but specially designed for Eagle Transmission. It is particularly durable and features a hard chrome finish and weight-saving hollow pins. A battery for the rear derailleur and a charging device are included.

You get two crank arms, a chainring, an electronically-controlled rear derailleur with AXS controller, a cassette and a chain, all from the durability-oriented X0 series for enduro, all-mountain and cross-country use. One of the special features of the Eagle Transmission is a derailleur hanger-free mounting of the electronic rear derailleur, which is mounted instead of the UDH universal derailleur hanger. The use of this groupset is therefore only possible on frames with this derailleur hanger. Direct mounting results in exact, tolerance-free alignment of the rear derailleur and an unprecedented harmony of rear derailleur and cassette. Adjustment bolts and limit screws are not required. In addition, the rear derailleur is designed to be extremely tough, so that it can easily withstand impacts from all sides and you can continue riding without any problems after a fall. The AXS Pod Ultimate Controller can be mounted on the left or right side. The XS-1295 cassette is nickel-plated to improve durability. It has one aluminium and eleven steel sprockets and offers a wide range with 10-52 teeth, whose gear jumps have been optimised compared to Eagle cassettes. The X-SYNC design enables outstanding shifting performance even and especially under full load. Thanks to cassette mapping, the gear changes take place along designated shift ramps, which makes the process extremely smooth. The crank arms are made of robust aluminium. The 36-tooth chainring is precisely matched to T-type chains, as are the cassette sprockets and derailleur pulleys. The X0 chain has a special flattop design reminiscent of road chains, but specially designed for Eagle Transmission. It scores with high durability thanks to solid pins and a corrosion-preventing PVD coating. A battery for the rear derailleur and a charging device are included. Use the groupset together with the AXS app to set it up, fine-tune the shifting behaviour and make and view other settings.

It includes a chainring, an electronically-controlled rear derailleur with AXS controller, a cassette and a chain, all from the durability-oriented X0 series for enduro, all-mountain and cross-country use. One of the special features of the Eagle Transmission is a derailleur hanger-free mounting of the electronic rear derailleur, which is mounted instead of the UDH universal derailleur hanger. The use of this groupset is therefore only possible on frames with this derailleur hanger. Direct mounting results in exact, tolerance-free alignment of the rear derailleur and an unprecedented harmony of rear derailleur and cassette. Adjustment bolts and limit screws are not required. In addition, the rear derailleur is designed to be extremely tough, so that it can easily withstand impacts from all sides and you can continue riding without any problems after a fall. The AXS Pod Ultimate Controller can be mounted on the left or right side. The XS-1295 cassette is nickel-plated to improve durability. It has one aluminium and eleven steel sprockets and offers a wide range with 10-52 teeth, whose gear jumps have been optimised compared to Eagle cassettes. The X-SYNC design enables outstanding shifting performance even and especially under full load. Thanks to cassette mapping, the gear changes take place along designated shift ramps, which makes the process extremely smooth. The 34-tooth chainring is precisely matched to T-type chains, as are the cassette sprockets and derailleur pulleys. The X0 chain has a special flattop design reminiscent of road chains, but specially designed for Eagle Transmission. It scores with high durability thanks to solid pins and a corrosion-preventing PVD coating. A battery for the rear derailleur and a charging device are included.

A key feature of Eagle Transmission is the direct-mount electronic derailleur, which is installed without a traditional derailleur hanger – instead, it mounts directly onto the UDH (Universal Derailleur Hanger) interface. As such, this group is only compatible with frames that support UDH. This direct-mount design results in a precise, play-free alignment of the derailleur, enabling seamless interaction between cassette and shifting. There’s no need for adjustment or limit screws. The derailleur is also built to be extremely durable, easily withstanding impacts from all directions, so you can keep riding even after a crash. With the included AXS Pod Ultimate controller, you can manage your shifting with ease while on the go. X-SYNC technology ensures outstanding shifting performance even under heavy load. Thanks to cassette mapping, gear changes occur along specially designed shift ramps, delivering an exceptionally smooth transition. The crankset is made of durable aluminum arms and features a direct-mount chainring, available with 32 or 34 teeth. Both the chainring, cassette, and pulley wheels are specially matched to T-Type chains. The X0 inspired chain stands out with its distinctive Flattop profile, reminiscent of road chains, but specifically developed for the Eagle Transmission system. With the integrated power meter, you can precisely analyze your rides and fine-tune your training. If you’re looking for a unique upgrade for your bike, this transmission group is the perfect match – cutting-edge technology wrapped in timeless design.",,2025-12-29 16:45:03,2025-12-29 16:45:03

You get a crankset, an electronically-controlled rear derailleur with AXS controller, a cassette and a chain, all from the XX series for all-mountain trails and enduro race tracks. One of the special features of the Eagle Transmission is a derailleur hanger-free mounting of the electronic rear derailleur, which is mounted instead of the UDH universal derailleur hanger. The use of this groupset is therefore only possible on frames with this derailleur hanger. Direct mounting results in exact, tolerance-free alignment of the rear derailleur and an unprecedented harmony of rear derailleur and cassette. Adjustment bolts and limit screws are not required. In addition, the rear derailleur is designed to be extremely tough, so that it can easily withstand impacts from all sides and you can continue riding without any problems after a fall. Via the Magic Wheel, the lower derailleur pulley, the chain simply continues to run if a branch or something similar gets in the way. The AXS Pod Ultimate Controller can be mounted on the left or right side. The XS-1297 cassette has one aluminium and eleven steel sprockets and offers a wide range with 10-52 teeth, whose gear jumps have been optimised compared to Eagle cassettes. The X-SYNC design enables outstanding shifting performance even and especially under full load. Thanks to cassette mapping, the gear changes take place along designated shift ramps, which makes the process extremely smooth. The crankset is lightweight and stiff thanks to the carbon arms with foam core and is combined with a Direct Mount chainring with 32 teeth. Like the cassette sprockets and derailleur pulleys, this is precisely matched to T-Type chains. The XX chain has a special flattop design reminiscent of road chains, but specially designed for Eagle Transmission. It is particularly durable and features a hard chrome finish and weight-saving hollow pins. A battery for the rear derailleur and a charging device are included.

You get a power meter crank, an electronic rear derailleur with AXS controller, a cassette and a chain, all from the XX-SL series designed for low weight for cross-country use. One of the special features of the Eagle Transmission is a derailleur hanger-free mounting of the electronic rear derailleur, which is mounted instead of the UDH universal derailleur hanger. The use of this groupset is therefore only possible on frames with this derailleur hanger. Direct mounting results in exact, tolerance-free alignment of the rear derailleur and an unprecedented harmony of rear derailleur and cassette. Adjustment bolts and limit screws are not required. In addition, the rear derailleur is designed to be extremely tough, so that it can easily withstand impacts from all sides and you can continue riding without any problems after a fall. Via the Magic Wheel, the lower derailleur pulley, the chain simply continues to run if a branch or something similar gets in the way. To reduce weight, the XX SL rear derailleur is equipped with a carbon cage. The AXS Pod Ultimate Controller can be mounted on the left or right side. The XS-1299 cassette has three sprockets made of aluminium and eight made of steel and offers a wide range with 10-52 teeth, whose gear jumps have been optimised compared to Eagle cassettes. The X-SYNC design enables outstanding shifting performance even and especially under full load. Thanks to cassette mapping, the gear changes take place along designated shift ramps, which makes the process extremely smooth. Thanks to hollow carbon arms, the power meter crank is particularly light and stiff and impresses with its innovative design. It includes a spider with power measurement on both sides, which is very accurate with only +/- 1.5% deviation, and a thread-mount chainring with 34 teeth. Like the cassette sprockets and derailleur pulleys, this is precisely matched to T-Type chains. The XX SL chain has a special flattop design reminiscent of road chains, but specially designed for Eagle Transmission. The outer flaps contain recesses to reduce weight. A battery for the rear derailleur and a charging device are included. Use the groupset together with the AXS app to set it up, fine-tune the shifting behaviour and make and view other settings.

Shimano has also extended its "" Science of Speed"" to the more affordable series compared to Dura-Ace and Ultegra and equips it with the retreaded, semi-wireless Di2 platform. This works without cables at the crucial point, namely in the interaction between STIs and rear derailleur. Cables are only used between the battery and the rear derailleur or front derailleur. The wireless protocol is extremely fast and reliable, which raises the shifting speed to a new level - with consistently high precision. That's not all: this 105 groupset is also the first with twelve rear gears, so you have a wider gear selection and are optimally prepared for any terrain. Conveniently, the 105 12-speed cassettes are also compatible with older Shimano road freehubs. Combined with the advanced disc brake system, the R7150 lets you experience every day on a road bike anew and discover the street as a space of endless possibilities. The 105 Di2 R7150 Road groupset by Shimano consists of a 2x12-speed crank with 34-50 tooth gradation, a flat mount disc brake set and an electronic rear derailleur and front derailleur for semi-wireless shifting.

The SRAM AXS app allows you to view battery status, change component behaviour, adjust controls, receive maintenance reminders and update firmware. Reach Adjust The fit and ergonomics of the brake lever is a very personal matter. Riders have individual position preferences as well as unique hand sizes and finger lengths. The grip width adjustment makes it child's play to adjust the lever - for maximum control. Bleeding Edge Bleeding Edge technology allows quick and easy bleeding of the brakes. Due to the special fluid channel and the improved bleed opening, the fluid can be pumped more easily through the brake calliper. A special adapter can be fitted to the bleed port and seals the system to prevent air ingress and fluid loss. Stealth-a-majig With Stealth-a-majig, installing the hydraulic hose during assembly is child's play. Its smaller size allows easy internal cable routing, which gives the bike a tidy look. DUB The unit of crankshaft and bottom bracket is the heart of the DUB technology. Stiffness meets durability. SRAM has gone a step further and made everything even easier and better. It is mainly the system approach through the integration of chainring, crank, spindle and bottom bracket that means better drivetrain performance. X-Range The X-Range technology was developed with the possibilities of today's dropbar bikes in mind. It is distinguished by a broad gear range with smooth, even gear changes. The combination of chainrings with 13-tooth spacing with a high bandwidth cassette, starting with a 10-tooth sprocket, ensures well thought-out, homogeneous gear jumps and always puts you in the right gear. In combination with AXS, you can make various shift settings and personalise your drivetrain to suit you. X-Sync The X-Sync tooth design is characterised by long, rounded and slanted tooth edges with a narrow profile. Derailleur pulleys with X-Sync technology support the chain guide and remain unaffected by dust and mud. Orbit Orbit technology is an innovative form of rear derailleur movement control. It uses silicone fluid as part of an elegant and ultralight damper system. Compared to a conventional friction clutch system, the Orbit technology generates no additional resistance at the rear derailleur spring during slow or light movement. This results in easier shifting and removal of the rear wheel. During the ride, the liquid damper holds the chain back in a sophisticated and elegant way. With the highest reliability and chain tension, for 2x and 1x systems. Yaw The Yaw technology allows trim-free shifting, as the front derailleur cage describes an arc and is therefore at a constant angle to the chain. Shifting transitions are thus more direct and precise, providing unprecedented performance when shifting up front.

Of course, a rechargeable battery, a Quick-Link chain and a cassette with 11-30 or 11-34 teeth are also included. Shimano has uncompromisingly designed the Dura-Ace R9250 for speed and performance. User-friendliness, efficiency and safety also played a major role in development. That's why the groupset works without cables at the crucial point, namely the interaction between STIs and rear derailleur. Cables are only used between the battery and the rear derailleur or front derailleur. The wireless protocol is extremely fast and reliable, which raises the shifting speed to a new level - with consistently high precision. A twelfth sprocket on the cassette in combination with a very clever gradation means that you have a wider gear selection at your disposal, and are optimally prepared for any terrain. In addition, Hyperglide+ technology familiar in MTB sport ensures smooth gliding of the chain even under loads. Conveniently, the Dura-Ace 12-speed cassettes are also compatible with older Shimano road freehubs. Last but not least, the disc brakes have been thoroughly revised and equipped with servo-wave technology. This way, the full braking power is not only available more quickly, but can also be modulated better. A simplified bleeding process and more free space for the brake pads are further advantages. The crank comes with integrated power measurement on both sides, which boasts an even higher accuracy than before, with a deviation of only 1.5%. The power meter functions with a built-in battery that is charged via the same cable as the derailleur battery.

The drivetrain is controlled wirelessly and ensures precise, fast gear changes, while the hydraulic disc brakes not only look good, but are also powerful. The shift/brake levers are designed for different hand sizes and shapes and can be adapted to your needs in terms of reach and contact point. You can use the AXS app to customise your drivetrain and configure two additional buttons on the sides of the levers.

The SRAM AXS app allows you to view battery status, change component behaviour, adjust controls, receive maintenance reminders and update firmware. Reach Adjust The fit and ergonomics of the brake lever is a very personal matter. Riders have individual position preferences as well as unique hand sizes and finger lengths. The grip width adjustment makes it child's play to adjust the lever - for maximum control. Bleeding Edge Bleeding Edge technology allows quick and easy bleeding of the brakes. Due to the special fluid channel and the improved bleed opening, the fluid can be pumped more easily through the brake calliper. A special adapter can be fitted to the bleed port and seals the system to prevent air ingress and fluid loss. Stealth-a-majig With Stealth-a-majig, installing the hydraulic hose during assembly is child's play. Its smaller size allows easy internal cable routing, which gives the bike a tidy look. DUB The unit of crankshaft and bottom bracket is the heart of the DUB technology. Stiffness meets durability. SRAM has gone a step further and made everything even easier and better. It is mainly the system approach through the integration of chainring, crank, spindle and bottom bracket that means better drivetrain performance. X-Range The X-Range technology was developed with the possibilities of today's dropbar bikes in mind. It is distinguished by a broad gear range with smooth, even gear changes. The combination of chainrings with 13-tooth spacing with a high bandwidth cassette, starting with a 10-tooth sprocket, ensures well thought-out, homogeneous gear jumps and always puts you in the right gear. In combination with AXS, you can make various shift settings and personalise your drivetrain to suit you. X-Sync The X-Sync tooth design is characterised by long, rounded and slanted tooth edges with a narrow profile. Derailleur pulleys with X-Sync technology support the chain guide and remain unaffected by dust and mud. Orbit Orbit technology is an innovative form of rear derailleur movement control. It uses silicone fluid as part of an elegant and ultralight damper system. Compared to a conventional friction clutch system, the Orbit technology generates no additional resistance at the rear derailleur spring during slow or light movement. This results in easier shifting and removal of the rear wheel. During the ride, the liquid damper holds the chain back in a sophisticated and elegant way. With the highest reliability and chain tension, for 2x and 1x systems.

Unlike other seatpost clamps, Squeezy does not have a continuous collar on the top. This collar, as found on common seatpost clamps, serves only as a mounting aid, but stiffens the clamps unnecessarily at the upper edge and thus prevents the most even deformation and clamping. Without a continuous collar, the clamp can nestle better and apply the clamping effect more gently and evenly around the seat tube (and not just selectively). In combination with the compact design with the titanium screw located as close as possible to the seat tube, the same clamping forces with less tightening torque or higher clamping forces with the same tightening torque can be achieved. Particularly in connection with telescopic seatposts, a clamping force that is evenly distributed over the circumference can positively influence the function of the post. To prevent the clamp from sliding down over the seat tube during installation, Squeezy has three small slip stops. weight: 7 g (31.8 mm) to 9 g (39 mm)bundle-less design for even distribution of clamping forceTi-6Al-4V Titanium Clamping Screw with Torx drivetrainSlip-Stopps as mounting aid 1 x BikeYoke Squeezy seatpost clamp","{""Application"": ""Road, Gravel, MTB"", ""Material"": ""aluminium (7075-T6), titanium bolt"", ""Compatibility"": ""Outer seat tube diameter 35 mm, 38 mm"", ""38 mm"": ""SQZ38"", ""35 mm"": ""SQZ35""}",2025-12-29 16:52:29,2025-12-29 16:52:29

This is necessary for optimal performance. The OT-RS900 should be cut from the correct side when adjusting the length. One of the two ends is flare-processed. This flare-processed end is inserted into the barrel adjuster of the rear derailleur and should therefore remain there. OT-RS900 For Dura-Ace, Ultegra, 105, GRX and other 11-speed or 12-speed road and gravel rear derailleurs, Shimano has developed the special OT-RS900 cable housing. It is less stiff than the conventional OT-SP41 housing and is therefore better suited to the tight curve where the cable is routed from the frame to the rear derailleur. Thanks to OT-RS900, problems with the barrel adjuster can be prevented and the rear wheel can be removed more easily.

Like its predecessor, it is installed internally in the frame, typically in the seatpost. It has three connections and supplies power to all electronic components via the thin EW-SD300 power cable (not included): the rear derailleur, the front derailleur and, in a fully wired set-up, the two shift/brake levers. Unlike previous models, BT-DN300 does not have its own charging socket, but is charged via the rear derailleur. It is also not Bluetooth-enabled. The nominal voltage of the battery is 7.4 volts, the nominal capacity 500 mAh. A full charge takes up to 1.5 hours if the charging cable is connected to a power supply unit with a USB port, or up to 3 hours if it is connected to the USB port on a computer.

This is an extremely flat profile which, combined with the more direct positioning, reduces the risk of damage and ensures clean, quiet shifting in all conditions. In addition, the direct mount compatibility results in a new mounting option. The Ultegra rear derailleur, which is mainly made of aluminium, is available in two versions: one with a short cage (SS type) for cassettes up to 11-30 and the second with a longer cage (GS type) for cassettes up to a gradation of 11-34.

Due to its generous total capacity of 41 teeth, you can shift 12-speed cassettes with a largest sprocket of 34 to 36 teeth, which is also a novelty in road cycling. The compact unit, which only weighs about 40 grams more than the Ultegra model due to its high aluminium content, contains a lot of high-tech features: the wireless unit for wireless communication with the STIs, the charging port, which you can use to easily recharge your shifters and derailleurs with the help of the matching charging cable, and a function button. You can use it to adjust the rear derailleur, check the battery status, change the shift mode from manual to Synchro and Semi-Synchro Shift or establish a Bluetooth connection to a bike computer or smartphone. An LED display helps you to do this. The rear derailleur is connected to the battery via a cable, from which a cable also runs to the front derailleur. It impresses with its fast, precise shifting processes as well as with its Flat Shadow design, which optimises the shifting behaviour and prevents damage. Information on the return and disposal of batteries and electrical equipment can be found here . function button, charging port and wireless system in one compact unitDi2 wireless chip with low interference probability, high processing speed and low power consumptionLED status display (battery, pairing, settings mode, Synchro Shift)takes over the function of previous wireless units in establishing a wireless connection with compatible cycling computersflat designconnected to battery via cablefirmware updates via E-Tube Project4 fluorine-coated joint bushespainted cage Shadow RD Shadow rear derailleurs from Shimano have a very flat profile, allowing for a more aggressive riding style by minimising the risk of getting stuck on obstacles. In addition, the single preload ensures that the rear derailleur does not hit the chain stay even on very uneven ground. All of this contributes to a quiet, clean-operating gearshift. Digital Integrated Intelligence (Di2) Di2 systems are the electronic shifting systems from Shimano. They are based on the SEIS, the Shimano Electronic Intelligent System, which takes over the index shifting function from the mechanical components, only via power cables or radio signals and not via a Bowden cable. Shifting is done by simply pressing a button. This has the advantage that no great effort is required, your concentration on the ride is not disturbed and operation is easy even with cold hands. In addition, the electronic gear changes are very fast and highly precise. There is also no risk of a defective circuit due to dirty cables or other problems. You can adjust individual settings via the E-Tube Project, such as adjusting the shifting speed, the number of shifting operations per button press or the Synchro or Semi-Synchro shifting function. Shimano offers an app for this purpose. Gear maintenance and firmware updates are also done via E-Tube, with the bike connected to a PC running the appropriate E-Tube software for more extensive workshop work. D-Fly Shimano D-Fly is a Near Field Communication (NFC) network that allows Shimano E-Tube electronic components (Di2, STEPS) and smartphones or compatible bike computers to communicate with each other. For example, it is possible to view information about the components on the display or to track power meter data. Shimano provides the E-Tube Ride app just for this purpose. D-Fly is compatible with ANT+, ANT as well as Bluetooth. Network partners include Garmin, Wahoo, Sigma and Cateye for Di2 components and Garmin and Sigma for STEPS components. Shimano Synchronized Shift Shimano's synchronised shifting function is a shifting mode that automatically matches the Di2 rear derailleur and Di2 front derailleur. It is activated either via the E-Tube platform or via the rear derailleurs with a function button. Synchro Shift means that the front derailleur automatically selects a suitable gear depending on the position of the rear derailleur, while Semi-Synchro Shift means that a suitable rear derailleur position is automatically set when you operate the front derailleur. This gives you the advantage that you only have to concentrate on one side of the shifting process and are not thrown off-rhythm by sudden unfavourable changes to the gear ratio. long: 1 x Shimano 105 Di2 RD-R7150 rear derailleur1 x Shimano TL-EW300 cable tool1 x adjustment tool","{""Series"": ""105 Di2 R7150"", ""Application"": ""Road"", ""Gearing"": ""12-speed"", ""Mount"": ""standard (Direct Mount compatible)"", ""Capacity"": ""41-tooth"", ""Compatibility"": ""Shimano Road 12-speed"", ""Compatibility - Chains"": ""HG 12-speed"", ""Derailleur Pulleys"": ""11-tooth"", ""Outer Cage Material"": ""aluminium"", ""Inner Cage Material"": ""aluminium"", ""Other Materials"": ""aluminium, steel, stainless steel, composite material (GFRP)"", ""Power Cable"": ""EW-SD300-I (1 x connection)"", ""Shift/Brake Lever"": ""ST-R7170, ST-R8150, ST-R8170, ST-R8060, ST-R9250, ST-R9270, ST-R9160, ST-R9180"", ""Cassette"": ""CS-R7100-12, CS-R7101-12, CS-HG710-12, CS-R8100-12 (11-34 only), CS-R8101-12 (11-34 only), CS-R9200-12 (11-34 only)"", ""Chain"": ""CN-M8100, CN-M9100, CN-M7100, CN-M6100"", ""Charging Cable"": ""EW-EC300"", ""Max.

Thanks to baffles made of lightweight aluminium, there is a weight advantage of approx. 15 grams compared to the Ultegra model. With a total capacity of 16 teeth, this allows large chainrings with a maximum of 50 to 54 teeth to be shifted, whereby the shifting speed has been increased enormously compared to the past. The front derailleur is compatible with a chainline of 44.5 mm and is designed for braze-on mounting. With the help of a suitable adapter, however, it is also possible to mount a clamp on the frame. It is connected to the battery via a cable, which in turn is also connected to the rear derailleur and, if applicable, the STIs. Of course, FD-R9250 has the proven Synchro and Semi-Synchro Shift function, which enables an automated interaction with the rear derailleur and thus makes shifting easier.

Shifting is done by simply pressing a button. This has the advantage that no great effort is required, your concentration on the ride is not disturbed and operation is easy even with cold hands. In addition, the electronic gear changes are very fast and highly precise. There is also no risk of a defective circuit due to dirty cables or other problems. You can adjust individual settings via the E-Tube Project, such as adjusting the shifting speed, the number of shifting operations per button press or the Synchro or Semi-Synchro shifting function. Shimano offers an app for this purpose. Gear maintenance and firmware updates are also done via E-Tube, with the bike connected to a PC running the appropriate E-Tube software for more extensive workshop work. Shimano Synchronized Shift Shimano's synchronised shifting function is a shifting mode that automatically matches the Di2 rear derailleur and Di2 front derailleur. It is activated either via the E-Tube platform or via the rear derailleurs with a function button. Synchro Shift means that the front derailleur automatically selects a suitable gear depending on the position of the rear derailleur, while Semi-Synchro Shift means that a suitable rear derailleur position is automatically set when you operate the front derailleur.

With a total capacity of 16 teeth, this allows large chainrings with a maximum of 50 to 52 teeth to be shifted, whereby the shifting speed has been increased enormously compared to the past. The front derailleur is compatible with a chainline of 44.5 mm and is designed for braze-on mounting. With the help of a suitable adapter, however, it is also possible to mount a clamp on the frame. It is connected to the battery via a cable, which in turn is also connected to the rear derailleur and, if applicable, the STIs. Of course, FD-R8150 has the proven Synchro and Semi-Synchro Shift function, which enables an automated interaction with the rear derailleur and thus makes shifting easier.

They are based on the SEIS, the Shimano Electronic Intelligent System, which takes over the index shifting function from the mechanical components, only via power cables or radio signals and not via a Bowden cable. Shifting is done by simply pressing a button. This has the advantage that no great effort is required, your concentration on the ride is not disturbed and operation is easy even with cold hands. In addition, the electronic gear changes are very fast and highly precise. There is also no risk of a defective circuit due to dirty cables or other problems. You can adjust individual settings via the E-Tube Project, such as adjusting the shifting speed, the number of shifting operations per button press or the Synchro or Semi-Synchro shifting function. Shimano offers an app for this purpose. Gear maintenance and firmware updates are also done via E-Tube, with the bike connected to a PC running the appropriate E-Tube software for more extensive workshop work. Shimano Synchronized Shift Shimano's synchronised shifting function is a shifting mode that automatically matches the Di2 rear derailleur and Di2 front derailleur. It is activated either via the E-Tube platform or via the rear derailleurs with a function button. Synchro Shift means that the front derailleur automatically selects a suitable gear depending on the position of the rear derailleur, while Semi-Synchro Shift means that a suitable rear derailleur position is automatically set when you operate the front derailleur. This gives you the advantage that you only have to concentrate on one side of the shifting process and are not thrown off-rhythm by sudden unfavourable changes to the gear ratio.

This unique system is known for 40 - 60% less friction compared to standard derailleur pulleys and allows power savings of at least 1.6 and up to 2.4 watts. The OSPW system features the unique CeramicSpeed bearing, aluminium derailleur pulleys and a polyamide-carbon cage, making it 3 to 5 times more durable than standard systems on the market. A real advance in the field of cycling performance. Coated CeramicSpeed coated products offer the ultimate in performance and durability. This is achieved by a unique coating that increases the hardness of the races, so that in combination with the smoothness of CeramicSpeed ball bearings, there is virtually no bearing wear.

Ceramic Bearings by CeramicSpeed CeramicSpeed ceramic balls are rounder, harder, smoother, lighter and more resilient than steel balls and ceramic balls from other manufacturers. CeramicSpeed ceramic bearings therefore last 3 to 5 times longer than other bearings on the market. All CeramicSpeed bearings are handmade in Denmark under clean room conditions and subjected to a strict four-stage inspection process. Among other things, the size of the ceramic balls is checked down to the thousandth of a millimetre. Tests are then carried out in the laboratory or preferably by professionals in training and competition. CeramicSpeed bearings guarantee the lowest possible friction, optimised power transfer and maximum durability and also help you save watts and reach the finish line faster. It's not about seconds, it's about minutes! OSPW The Oversized Pulley Wheel System (OSPW system) is a breakthrough innovation from CeramicSpeed, developed in collaboration with world-class triathletes. This unique system is known for 40 - 60% less friction compared to standard derailleur pulleys and allows power savings of at least 1.6 and up to 2.4 watts. The OSPW system features the unique CeramicSpeed bearings, aluminium derailleur pulleys and a polyamide-carbon cage, making it 3 to 5 times more durable than standard systems on the market. Further Drive CeramicSpeed derailleur pulley systems with Further Drive technology are designed to make your drivetrain more durable and less sensitive to wear so that it works efficiently over a long period of time. This means you can still fully rely on it at the end of the race or late in the season. Further Drive includes a completely revised cage structure of the OSPW system with greater material thickness, but without unnecessary weight. ADR and ALPHA Disc are also central components of the Further Drive concept. ALPHA Disc ALPHA Disc is a two-part construction that affects the lower pulley, the tension pulley. The teeth have a Narrow-Wide profile for better chain retention and are made of a highly wear-resistant, noise-reducing composite material. They sit on a solid aluminium disc, which prevents foreign objects such as branches from getting caught. At the same time, the disc increases the strength and rigidity of the derailleur pulley. The first ALPHA discs were tested at the Cyclocross World Cup. The technology was then used regularly by the Tormans CX Team sponsored by CeramicSpeed and was able to impress in the most difficult conditions. Before transporting the bicycle in a travel bag, the rear derailleur should be completely disassembled, otherwise the OSPW system could be damaged. 1 x CeramicSpeed OSPW RS Alpha derailleur pulley system for Shimano R9250 / R81501 x CeramicSpeed oil, 15 ml dropper bottle","{""Application"": ""Road, Triathlon & Time Trial"", ""Gearing"": ""12-speed"", ""Cassette Teeth (max.)"": ""34-tooth"", ""Compatibility"": ""Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 RD-R9250, Ultegra Di2 RD-R8150"", ""Derailleur Pulleys"": ""13 tooth (upper derailleur pulley), 19 tooth (lower derailleur pulley)"", ""Outer Cage Material"": ""polyamide"", ""Inner Cage Material"": ""polyamide"", ""Other Materials"": ""aluminium, composite"", ""Bearings"": ""Ceramic"", ""black"": ""113490"", ""team edition-black"": ""113491""}",2025-12-29 17:00:33,2025-12-29 17:00:33

Unfortunately, it's a problem that many tubeless riders are all-too familiar with. The product development engineer and enthusiastic mountain biker Pius Kobler decided to find a solution, and thus developed the milKit system. With milKit, you can now check the fill level and condition of the sealant in just a few minutes and replace it if necessary without having to deflate or remove your tyre. It's that easy! Features:Fast: Measure and refill the sealant without letting air out of the tyre.Clean: No clogged valves. A rubber flap prevents sealant from intruding.Simple: clean hands and easy to use.Reliable: milKit shows exactly how much sealing milk is in the tyre.Application:Unscrew the valve heart from the milKit valve: air remains in the tyreInsert the milKit applicator through the valve into the tyre and measure the amount of sealantCheck the quantity and quality of the sealantDose out the required refill quantity in the same wayScrew the valve heart back into the valveContents:1 x milKit measuring and refill syringe2 x milKit tubeless valves1 x milKit connecting tube1 x milKit valve key1 x milKit tool for valve corewithoutTyre Sealantnot incl. rim tape",,2025-12-29 17:16:48,2025-12-29 17:16:48

This gives you access to information about your overall performance, cadence, torque efficiency, left-right balance and round pedalling. The accuracy of the 24 strain gauges can be described as very high with a deviation of only 1.5%. Thanks to Bluetooth and ANT+ radio protocol, there is broad compatibility with bike computers and similar devices. The lithium-ion battery is located in control unit on the crank spider, which you can easily recharge yourself. If it is completely full again after about 2.5 hours, it will last for at least 300 hours. By the way, the charging cable is the same as for your Ultegra Di2 shifters. You can also carry out firmware updates via the E-Tube Project. On the housing of the control unit, you will find an LED that signals the battery charge level and a button for easy zero calibration. Of course, the entire construction is waterproof and there is active temperature compensation, so you don't have to worry about the weather. You can attach the magnet for cadence measurement to the chainstay, seat tube or down tube using the included positioning tool. Apart from these special features, the FC-R8100-P is technically identical to the "" normal"" Ultegra crankset. It converts your power into propulsion in a highly efficient manner, is characterised by an optimal stability/weight ratio thanks to the Hollowtech II design and inspires with precise, fast shifting processes. The crank arms are hollow-formed, as is the large chainring, which is partly made of carbon, resulting in significant weight savings. Apart from the axle, all essential parts were made of lightweight metal. FC-R8100-P has an asymmetrical 4-arm bolt circle diameter of 110 mm. It produces a chainline of 44.5 mm and has a Q-factor of 148 mm.

It is based on an integration of the bottom bracket and the right crank arm and works with a 24 mm axle or bearing diameter, which has proven to be optimal in terms of stability. In many cases, the bearing cups are on the outside so that the load is better distributed. High-quality precision seals ensure a long service life. Second-Generation Power Meters Shimano second-generation power meters use an improved force vector analysis and are therefore more accurate than their predecessors. Both crank arms have 12 sensors each, which are mounted in such a way that the crank deformation can be compensated for and the acting forces can be identified. The right and left sides are connected via the battery located in the axle, ensuring accurate measurement on both sides. The built-in temperature compensation contributes to the precision. You can easily recharge the battery with the Di2 charging cable EW-EC300. The power meters have Bluetooth and ANT+ compatibility to communicate with bike computers and smartphones. For firmware updates and data display, Shimano provides the E-Tube Project Cyclist App or the E-Tube Ride App. A more detailed performance analysis is possible via Shimano Connect Lab software. 1 x Shimano Ultegra FC-R8100-P power meter crankset (34-50or36-52)1 x Shimano crank bolt1 x Shimano EW-EC300 charging cable, 1.5 m1 x installation ring for left crank arm1 x magnets1 x magnet cover, black1 x magnet cover, white2 x double-sided adhesive tape rolls1 x Shimano TL-FC40 crank tool for left crank arm1 x cover cap for left crank arm1 x positioning tool for magnet","{""Application"": ""Road"", ""Type"": ""power meter crankset (dual-sided)"", ""Compatibility"": ""Shimano 2x12-speed"", ""Chainring Mount"": ""110 mm bolt circle diameter, 4-arm asymmetrical"", ""Series"": ""Ultegra R8100"", ""Crank Arm Material"": ""aluminium"", ""Chainring Material"": ""Aluminium / Carbon, Aluminium"", ""Axle Material"": ""steel"", ""Gradation"": ""34-50, 36-52"", ""Crank Arm Length"": ""170.0 mm, 172.5 mm, 175.0 mm"", ""Chainline"": ""44.5 mm"", ""Q-Factor"": ""148 mm"", ""Axle Diameter"": ""24 mm"", ""Compatible BSA Shell Width"": ""68 mm"", ""Recommended Bottom Bracket"": ""SM-BBR60 or SM-BB72-41B Press Fit Hollowtech II (not included)"", ""Recommended Chain"": ""CN-M8100"", ""Tolerance"": ""+/- 1.5%"", ""Point of Measurement"": ""crank arm"", ""Power Source"": ""lithium-ion battery, integrated"", ""Battery Life"": ""300+ h"", ""Data Collected"": ""power, power balance left / right, pedal smoothness*, cadence, torque effectiveness*"", ""Data Transfer"": ""ANT+, Bluetooth"", ""Shift/Brake Lever"": ""ST-R8150, ST-R8170, ST-R8060, ST-R9250, ST-R9270, ST-R9160, ST-R9180, ST-R7170, ST-R7120, ST-RX820, ST-RX610"", ""Front Derailleur"": ""FD-R8150, FD-R9250, FD-R7150, FD-R7100"", ""Bottom Bracket"": ""BB-R9100, SM-BB9000, SM-BBR60, SM-BB6700, SM-BB5700, BB-RS501, BB-RS500, SM-BB4600, SM-BB92-41B, SM-BB72-41B, SM-BB71-41B, BB-RS500-PB"", ""Chain"": ""CN-M8100, CN-M9100, CN-M7100, CN-M6100"", ""170.0 mm 34-50"": ""I-FCR8100PCX04A"", ""170.0 mm 36-52"": ""I-FCR8100PCX26A"", ""172.5 mm 34-50"": ""I-FCR8100PDX04A"", ""172.5 mm 36-52"": ""I-FCR8100PDX26A"", ""175.0 mm 34-50"": ""I-FCR8100PEX04A"", ""175.0 mm 36-52"": ""I-FCR8100PEX26A""}",2025-12-29 17:24:43,2025-12-29 17:24:43

This gives you access to information about your overall performance, cadence, torque efficiency, left-right balance and round pedalling. The accuracy of the 24 strain gauges can be described as very high with a deviation of only 1.5%. Thanks to Bluetooth and ANT+ radio protocol, there is broad compatibility with bike computers and similar devices. The lithium-ion battery is located in control unit on the crank spider, which you can easily recharge yourself. If it is completely full again after about 2.5 hours, it will last for at least 300 hours. By the way, the charging cable is the same as for your Ultegra Di2 shifters. You can also carry out firmware updates via the E-Tube Project. On the housing of the control unit, you will find an LED that signals the battery charge level and a button for easy zero calibration. Of course, the entire construction is waterproof and there is active temperature compensation, so you don't have to worry about the weather. You can attach the magnet for cadence measurement to the chainstay, seat tube or down tube using the included positioning tool. Apart from these special features, the FC-R8100-P is technically identical to the "" normal"" Ultegra crank. It converts your power into propulsion in a highly efficient manner, is characterised by an optimal stability/weight ratio thanks to the Hollowtech II design and inspires with precise, fast shifting processes. The crank arms are hollow-formed, which results in a significant weight saving. Except for the axle, all essential parts were made of lightweight metal. FC-R8100-P has an asymmetrical 4-arm bolt circle diameter of 110 mm. It produces a chainline of 44.5 mm and has a Q-factor of 148 mm.

It is based on an integration of the bottom bracket and the right crank arm and works with a 24 mm axle or bearing diameter, which has proven to be optimal in terms of stability. In many cases, the bearing cups are on the outside so that the load is better distributed. High-quality precision seals ensure a long service life. Second-Generation Power Meters Shimano second-generation power meters use an improved force vector analysis and are therefore more accurate than their predecessors. Both crank arms have 12 sensors each, which are mounted in such a way that the crank deformation can be compensated for and the acting forces can be identified. The right and left sides are connected via the battery located in the axle, ensuring accurate measurement on both sides. The built-in temperature compensation contributes to the precision. You can easily recharge the battery with the Di2 charging cable EW-EC300. The power meters have Bluetooth and ANT+ compatibility to communicate with bike computers and smartphones. For firmware updates and data display, Shimano provides the E-Tube Project Cyclist App or the E-Tube Ride App. A more detailed performance analysis is possible via Shimano Connect Lab software. 1 x Shimano Ultegra FC-R8100-P power meter crank1 x Shimano crank bolt1 x Shimano EW-EC300 charging cable, 1.5 m1 x installation ring for left crank arm1 x magnets1 x magnet cover, black1 x magnet cover, white2 x double-sided adhesive tape rolls1 x Shimano TL-FC40 crank tool for left crank arm1 x cover cap for left crank arm1 x positioning tool for magnet4 x chainring bolts Ultegra FC-R8100 chainrings","{""Application"": ""Road"", ""Type"": ""power meter cranks (on both sides)"", ""Compatibility"": ""2x"", ""Chainring Mount"": ""110 mm bolt circle diameter, 4-arm asymmetrical"", ""Series"": ""Ultegra R8100"", ""Crank Arm Material"": ""aluminium"", ""Axle Material"": ""steel"", ""Gradation"": ""34-50, 36-52"", ""Crank Arm Length"": ""165.0 mm, 170.0 mm, 172.5 mm, 175.0 mm"", ""Chainline"": ""44.5 mm"", ""Q-Factor"": ""148 mm"", ""Axle Diameter"": ""24 mm"", ""Compatible BSA Shell Width"": ""68 mm"", ""Recommended Bottom Bracket"": ""SM-BBR60 or SM-BB72-41B Press Fit Hollowtech II (not included)"", ""Recommended Chain"": ""CN-M8100"", ""Tolerance"": ""+/- 1.5%"", ""Point of Measurement"": ""crank arm"", ""Power Source"": ""lithium-ion battery, integrated"", ""Battery Life"": ""300+ h"", ""Data Collected"": ""power, power balance left / right, pedal smoothness*, cadence, torque effectiveness*"", ""Data Transfer"": ""ANT+, Bluetooth"", ""Shift/Brake Lever"": ""ST-R8150, ST-R8170, ST-R8060, ST-R9250, ST-R9270, ST-R9160, ST-R9180, ST-R7170, ST-R7120, ST-RX820, ST-RX610"", ""Front Derailleur"": ""FD-R8150, FD-R9250, FD-R7150, FD-R7100"", ""Bottom Bracket"": ""BB-R9100, SM-BB9000, SM-BBR60, SM-BB6700, SM-BB5700, BB-RS501, BB-RS500, SM-BB4600, SM-BB92-41B, SM-BB72-41B, SM-BB71-41B, BB-RS500-PB"", ""Chain"": ""CN-M8100, CN-M9100, CN-M7100, CN-M6100"", ""Chainrings"": ""Y-0NG34000, Y-0NG36000, Y-0NG98010, Y-0NG98020"", ""165.0 mm"": ""I-FCR8100PAXXA"", ""170.0 mm"": ""I-FCR8100PCXXA"", ""172.5 mm"": ""I-FCR8100PDXXA"", ""175.0 mm"": ""I-FCR8100PEXXA""}",2025-12-29 17:24:54,2025-12-29 17:24:54

This gives you access to information about your overall performance, cadence, torque efficiency, left-right balance and round pedalling. The accuracy of the total of 24 strain gauges is even higher than the previous model, with a deviation of only 1.5%. Thanks to Bluetooth and ANT+ radio protocol, there is broad compatibility with bike computers and similar devices. The lithium-ion battery is located in control unit on the crank spider, which you can easily recharge yourself. If it is completely full again after about 2.5 hours, it will last for at least 300 hours. By the way, the charging cable is the same as for your Dura-Ace Di2 shifter. You can also carry out firmware updates via the E-Tube Project. On the housing of the control unit, you will find an LED that signals the battery charge level and a button for easy zero calibration. Of course, the entire construction is waterproof and there is active temperature compensation, so you don't have to worry about the weather. You can attach the magnet for cadence measurement to the chainstay, seat tube or down tube using the included positioning tool. Apart from these special features, the FC-R9200-P is technically identical to the "" normal"" Dura-Ace crankset. It converts your power into propulsion in a highly efficient manner, is characterised by an optimal stability/weight ratio thanks to the Hollowtech II design and inspires with precise, fast shifting processes. The crank arms are hollow-formed, as is the large chainring, which is partly made of carbon, resulting in significant weight savings. Apart from the axle, all essential parts were made of lightweight metal. FC-R9200-P has an asymmetrical 4-arm bolt circle diameter of 110 mm. It produces a chainline of 44.5 mm and has a Q-factor of 148 mm. The 40-54 tooth gradation option is specifically designed for competition use.

It is based on an integration of the bottom bracket and the right crank arm and works with a 24 mm axle or bearing diameter, which has proven to be optimal in terms of stability. In many cases, the bearing cups are on the outside so that the load is better distributed. High-quality precision seals ensure a long service life. Second-Generation Power Meters Shimano second-generation power meters use an improved force vector analysis and are therefore more accurate than their predecessors. Both crank arms have 12 sensors each, which are mounted in such a way that the crank deformation can be compensated for and the acting forces can be identified. The right and left sides are connected via the battery located in the axle, ensuring accurate measurement on both sides. The built-in temperature compensation contributes to the precision. You can easily recharge the battery with the Di2 charging cable EW-EC300. The power meters have Bluetooth and ANT+ compatibility to communicate with bike computers and smartphones.

The pedals' ground-breaking technology provides ultra-precise and reliable wattage readings, allowing you to redefine your goals. Based on hard facts, not just estimates, you'll get more out of your pedal strokes and make your training more efficient than ever. The Assioma Duo can be installed as easily as normal pedals and quickly transferred from one bike to another. Communication with your smartphone or bike computer is wireless via Bluetooth or ANT+. As an additional feature that previous versions of the pedal did not have, the release force is continuously adjustable from 8 to 20 Nm. Favero Electronics has over 30 years of experience in the field of electronic sports equipment and works closely with athletes. The Assioma Duo pedals, for example, have been extensively tested by the UCI Team Bardiani-CSF and successfully tried out in tough racing conditions.

Assioma is a pedal for Road cyclists, equipped with a sensor to measure the force applied to the pedal while pedalling. Assioma Duo integrates the cadence function and calculates the power of the individual leg in real time. The right pedal sends its data to the left pedal, which in turn sends the data from both pedals to the bike computer.

Favero power meter pedals provide an objective value which, unlike heart rate, cannot be influenced by external factors such as high temperatures, psychological stress, caffeine consumption, etc. 772-01 1 x Favero Assioma pedal body, left1 x Favero Assioma pedal body, right1 x Favero Assioma pedal axle, left, incl. sensor1 x Favero Assioma pedal axle, right1 pair of Favero cleats 6° (red)1 x USB cable w/ micro-USB plug, 2 m1 x Favero Assioma magnet plug for charging1 x charger1 x EU plug adapter1 x US plug adapter1 x UK plug adapter1 x AU plug adapter1 x 8 mm hex key4 x washers","{""Application"": ""Road, Triathlon & Time Trial"", ""Type"": ""clipless pedals with a power meter (left)"", ""Pedal System"": ""Favero"", ""Compatibility"": ""Look Kéo"", ""Body Material"": ""Composite"", ""Axle Material"": ""stainless steel (AISI 630 H900)"", ""Bearings"": ""cartridge"", ""Height"": ""10.5 mm"", ""Pedal Centre to Crank Arm Distance"": ""54 mm"", ""Tolerance"": ""+/-1 percent"", ""Power Source"": ""lithium-ion battery, integrated"", ""Battery Life"": ""approx. 50 hours"", ""Data Collected"": ""current power (0-3000 watts), current cadence (30-190 rpm), torque efficiency (left), round pedal (left), IAV Cycling Dynamics (Power Phase, Rider Position)"", ""Waterproof"": ""IP67"", ""Data Transfer"": ""ANT+, Bluetooth"", ""Weight Limit"": ""120 kg total weight"", ""Note"": ""Only use the Favero or original Look Kéo cleats supplied.

They also analyse other aspects of performance development depending on riding position and bike set-up, otherwise known as Cycling Dynamics. The pedals are easy to mount and can therefore be transferred from one bike to another seamlessly. The pedal bodies are interchangeable, which means they can also be used with Shimano SPD-SL cleats for MTB and gravel riding.

Based on this, the force that causes the propulsion (tangential vector) and the force that acts on the crank in the form of compression or elongation (radial vector) are considered equally. This results in a more realistic measurement in comparison to relying solely on the tangential vector, and gives you a better overall picture of pedalling forces. 010-02388-00 1 x Garmin Rally RK200 Pedal with Power Meter axle (left)1 x Garmin Rally RK200 Pedal with Power Meter axle (right)1 x pair Garmin Rally RK 6° Cleats6 x fixing screw for cleats2 x 2 mm washer2 x replacement gasket for battery compartment cover2 x CR1/3N batteries (installed) Optional accessories: Rally RS Pedal Body Replacement Kit for Shimano SPD-SL cleatsRally XC Pedal Body Exchange Kit for gravel/MTB use","{""Application"": ""Road, Triathlon & Time Trial, Track"", ""Type"": ""clipless pedals with power meters (on both sides)"", ""Body Material"": ""composite, metal"", ""Axle Material"": ""steel"", ""Seals"": ""double"", ""Height"": ""12.2 mm"", ""Pedal Centre to Crank Arm Distance"": ""53 mm"", ""Tolerance"": ""+/- 1%"", ""Power Source"": ""Lithium battery CR1/3N (2 x) or lithium battery LR44/SR44 (4 x)"", ""Battery Life"": ""max. 120 h"", ""Data Collected"": ""Power (both sides), cadence, Cycling Dynamics (including right-left balance, Power Phase, Platform Center Offset)"", ""Waterproof"": ""IPX7"", ""Data Transfer"": ""ANT+, Bluetooth"", ""Weight Limit"": ""105 kg total weight""}",2025-12-29 17:26:32,2025-12-29 17:26:32

Anatomically speaking, the pubic symphysis (the anterior cartilage connection between the two halves of the pelvis) is on average 1/4 lower in a female than in a male pelvis, and the angle of the pubic bones to each other is wider. Moreover, women tend to be more flexible, which means their pelvises often tilt forward further on the saddle. Unfortunately, this often results in high pressure in the genital area. Thanks to the far forward-slanted opening and wide V-shape saddle flanks, the emerging pressure is reliably distributed to the bony structures of the seat area. Particularly innovative: relief inlays in the seat and perineum area. The saddle has undergone an extensive development process, and has been thoroughly tested by the Canyon//Sram UCI Women's Team, the fastest women in the world. Innovative relief inlaysRelief opening for maximum reliefV-shape allows for optimal support in the pubic bone, with pressure shifted to bony structures.Narrow, sloping tail with a flat contour allows good freedom of movement downhill.Wide nose for wide relief opening without disturbing edges Pronounced relief channel The sensitive perineal and genital areas are particularly exposed to increased pressure when cycling. Ergon provides effective relief from sitting complaints and numbness through an anatomically adapted relief channel. Large area pressure distribution Cyclists in sporting disciplines sit on the saddle with their pelvis tilted forward. As a result, areas of the sit bones and the pubic arch are subjected to stress.

A multi-faceted development team made up of sports scientists, industrial designers, engineers and test riders used current studies and produced many prototypes to design a new generation of pressure-relieving saddles for men. These saddles effectively prevent sitting complaints such as numbness or general discomfort for most types of mountain biking. The SM Sport is the all-rounder for touring, trail riding and all-mountain and offers the best riding comfort thanks to the anatomically optimised relief channel in the sensitive perineal area and athletic comfort padding. Its flattened rear and Y-shape allow for optimal freedom of movement in the moderately inclined posture typical of MTBs. Relief opening for maximum reliefNarrow, sloping tail with flat contour allows for good freedom of movement downhill Effective Relief The extremely deep relief channel, which is lowered at the rear, ends in an opening at the lowest point. The construction combines all the perks of a perforated saddle without the disadvantages (e.g., a very stiff saddle shell) and achieves a particularly high relief in the sensitive perineum area. Too much pressure in this area often triggers discomfort and numbness in the genital region. Large area pressure distribution Cyclists in sporting disciplines sit on the saddle with their pelvis tilted forward. As a result, areas of the sit bones and the pubic arch are subjected to stress. Ergon saddles take this into account and allow for a large-area pressure distribution without pressure peaks. Flat rear A narrow, sloping rear with flat contours and a minimal ramp allows for good freedom of movement downhill.

The reason for this is the smaller radius that results when routing the cable from the frame to the rear derailleur, which cannot be created with the stiff standard OT-SP41 cable housing. The OT-RS900 is 240 mm long and has a diameter of 4 mm.

This is necessary for optimal performance. The OT-RS900 should be cut from the correct side when adjusting the length. One of the two ends is flare-processed. This flare-processed end is inserted into the barrel adjuster of the rear derailleur and should therefore remain there. OT-RS900 For Dura-Ace, Ultegra, 105, GRX and other 11-speed or 12-speed road and gravel rear derailleurs, Shimano has developed the special OT-RS900 cable housing. It is less stiff than the conventional OT-SP41 housing and is therefore better suited to the tight curve where the cable is routed from the frame to the rear derailleur. Thanks to OT-RS900, problems with the barrel adjuster can be prevented and the rear wheel can be removed more easily. OT-RS900 is not intended for use on the shift/brake lever side. 1 x Shimano OT-RS900 shifter cable housing1 x end caps, sealed, for rear derailleur1 x Shimano long pointed end caps","{""Application"": ""Road"", ""Diameter"": ""4 mm"", ""Length"": ""240 mm"", ""Recommended Cable Diameter"": ""1.2 mm"", ""Liner"": ""polyethylene"", ""black"": ""Y-0BM98011"", ""white"": ""Y-0BM98021"", ""hi-tech grey"": ""Y-0BM98041"", ""red"": ""Y-0BM98031""}",2025-12-29 17:30:48,2025-12-29 17:30:48

The screws are overtightened or even torn off. Instead of enjoying your new parts, you are now bitterly waiting for the next possible use of your bike. PRO has developed a torque wrench that is not only elegant, but also impressive in terms of function, so that exactly this misfortune will no longer happen to you in the future. The PRO torque wrench is a precision tool for correctly tightening bolts and nuts to a predefined torque. Its textured handle fits comfortably in the hand, the slim design improves handling in hard-to-reach places and the exclusive black finish with blue accents is pleasing to the eye of the user. Its own weight speaks for high value and the easy-to-read scale for good operability. This reliable tool makes it easy and safe to set the correct amount of torque. PRO's torque spanner has been carefully calibrated to ASME B107.14-2004 so that all values are within a measurement tolerance of +/- 4%.

It just works well in every position. The fine-toothed ratchet mechanism can be easily switched in both directions by means of a lever. This mechanism has exceptionally fine toothing with 80 teeth on the ring side and therefore ensures flexibility in the tightest spaces. In addition, the ring side is angled at 15° to the tool axis, making it easier to apply the key in confined working spaces. With the integrated holding function, you guide nuts and screws directly and safely to the place of use so that you can insert the thread there quickly and safely. This effectively prevents the screw or nut from falling off and time-consuming searching for it. Refitting, repositioning and adjusting force to avoid the risk of injury? That's in the past. With its end stop, the Joker reduces the risk of slipping downwards from the screw head. This makes driving screws easier and allows you to apply more force. To ensure that everything fits perfectly, the clever double hexagon geometry of the Joker makes a form-fitting connection with screw or nut. The replaceable, hardened metal plate in the Joker's jaws holds the screw securely in place. Both reduce the risk of slippage even at high torques. practical holding function by metal plate in the jawsno slipping due to end stopdouble hexagon geometry reduces the risk of slippagefine-toothed ratchet mechanism can be easily switched in both directions via a leveralways find the right tool thanks to the "" Take it easy"" colour-coding system that sorts tools by size 050200 1 x Wera Joker ring wrench w/ ratchet function","{""Function"": ""screwdriver"", ""Tool Type"": ""wrench"", ""Type"": ""ratcheting combination wrench set"", ""Size"": ""8 x 144 mm, 10 x 159 mm, 13 x 179 mm, 15 x 199 mm, 17 x 225 mm, 19 x 246 mm"", ""Handle Material"": ""steel (chrome-molybdenum)"", ""Length"": ""144 mm, 159 mm, 179 mm, 199 mm, 225 mm, 246 mm""}",2025-12-29 18:28:54,2025-12-29 18:28:54

The test should be carried out before longer bike rides, but especially before road or MTB races, so that you are not suddenly unpleasantly surprised by a jumping chain. With the Rohloff HG-Check, you can concentrate on your intensive bike tour or your race - the wear indicator will show you precisely what condition your Shimano sprockets are in. tool for checking the condition of HG sprocketsimportant before longer tours and races as well as before every chain swap Place the HG-Check one after the other on the sprockets to be checked on the HG cassette block mounted on the rear wheel. For sprockets with 12 to 21 teeth, angle the last chain link outwards with the measuring roller and press it against the chain. Press the lever handle firmly (approx. 10 kg) with the other hand in the direction of travel and, with the measuring chain loaded, swing the measuring roller into the tooth gap. If the measuring roller swings completely into the tooth space without resistance, the tooth profile is still secure. Even when the chain is swapped out, the new chain runs perfectly. If the measuring chain hits the tooth head or can only be swivelled into the tooth space with pressure, the sprocket is worn and should be replaced. If the electrode immediately jumps out of the toothing when pressure is applied to the handle, the amount of sprocket wear is particularly high. Sprockets with more than 21 teeth rarely wear in such a way that the chain run causes problems. An examination is therefore not absolutely necessary. Nevertheless, it can be checked here whether, when the electrode is fully inserted, it pops out when the lever is pressed. If the electrode remains in the gearing, the sprocket is OK. If it pops out, you can expect problems with very heavy chain loads. 3100 1 x Rohloff HG-Check sprocket wear indicator","{""Function"": ""sprocket wear indicator"", ""Compatibility"": ""Shimano HG (Hyperglide) up to 12-speed""}",2025-12-29 18:34:46,2025-12-29 18:34:46

In comparison to the previous version, the durability of both the spoke wrench and chain rivet has been significantly improved. The set is rounded out with two sealed storage capsules: the smaller capsule is intended for the (not included) Tubeless Plug Kit with insertion tool and patch, which helps to quickly seal holes in tubeless tires, while the larger capsule accommodates the smaller one and offers storage space for further accessories. Both are connected to the bottom part of the EDC V2 Tool's housing; alternatively, a CO 2 cartridge can be attached there. The system can be conveniently stowed in either the steerer tube of tapered forks or inside of the handle of a OneUp mini-pump. As for the former solution, a special headset cap is used instead of a star nut and a thread has to be cut into the aluminium steerer tube.

It is mounted instead of the star nut and pre-tensions your headset via a bolt. In doing so, it creates space for the Everyday Carry V2 tool set, which consists of a multi-tool with 10 functions and a tyre lever/chain riveter combination tool. Even the smaller storage capsule, in which a tubeless plug kit with insertion tool and patches can be stowed, still finds its place. The assembly of the Threadless Carrier can be done in 10 to 15 minutes. You just need to first make sure your fork has a long enough non-oval steerer tube and is not made of carbon. First, remove the star nut - a suitable M6 bolt that can be used in combination with a ratchet is included. To find out which of the four included installation bolts you need to use, measure the distance from the bottom of the fork crown to the top of the stem spacers, or the stem if you are not using spacers above the stem. Or you can use the indicator laser-etched on the container, starting from the 80 mm bolt. When you have found the right bolt, insert it into the lower end cap. Now insert the whole thing from below into the steerer tube, while you insert the Threadless Carrier from above. Turn it clockwise with one hand while holding it from below with the other hand. Then insert the EDC V2 Tool into the container and align the lid so that the lettering runs horizontally. Now you just have to tighten the bolt at the bottom of the fork opening to tighten the whole thing. After that, nothing stands in the way of a ride, and you now always have the most important tools with you without having to carry a bag.

With the Sprint, the wheel is placed on a horizontal rail and fixed either to the fork or to the rear dropout with a clamping mechanism. An adapter ensures that quick release or thru-axle mounts can be clamped in all conceivable dimensions. The frame is additionally supported by placing the bottom bracket shell on a special plate. This means that the wheel is in the safe assembly position in no time at all, which can also be adjusted over an enormously wide range in the working height from 76 to 121 cm, as well as always being optimally balanced thanks to the horizontal displacement of the fixing points. In addition, the system can be rotated through 360°, so that literally every hand movement can be carried out in the optimum position. Nevertheless, thanks to its three wide-reaching tripod legs, the Sprint stands extremely securely and stably not only on level workshop floors but also off-road. In general, the Sprint is predestined for outdoor use. Thanks to its manufacture from a very light aluminium alloy, it has a transport-friendly total weight of 5.7 kilograms, while the protective anodisation ensures extreme weather resistance. When folded, the Sprint also stands out for its small pack size. It can shoulder an impressive 38 kilograms and therefore does not fall to its knees even with heavy mountain bikes or even e-bikes.

The lightweight, handy bottle can be used either at rest or on-the-go. Mounting a tubeless tyre requires a strong blast of air so that the tyre bead quickly presses into the rim flange, thus sealing the tyre. Depending on the tyre-rim combination, this is not always possible with conventional floor pumps, according to Peter Krischio, Schwalbe Race Product Manager. A compressor helps in the professional workshop or at the gas station. For safe and easy fitting without a compressor, Schwalbe is now launching the Tire Booster, which was created in cooperation with the British start-up company Airshot. With it, up to 11 bars of air pressure can be brought into the tyre quickly. This means that the tyre immediately sits securely on the rim and seals evenly everywhere, says Peter Krischio. The Tire Booster is a significant advantage in tubeless mounting. At a light weight of 435 grams, you can easily take it with you. If you need stronger airflow, you can also use a special adapter. For this purpose, the valve core is removed and the adapter is screwed directly onto the valve stem, which in turn maximises the airflow. This is how it works: connect the Tire Booster with a conventional floor pump via the SV valve on the Tire Booster, pump up the bottle and then activate the quick-release valve. Immediately, the air is distributed evenly and the tyre sits firmly on the rim - usually with the typical loud crackling sound. no compressor requiredlever to regulate the rare of air flowgenerates a pressure of 11 bar for a short timeBooster is filled via a floor pump (SV valve)for at home or on the road 6080.01 1 x Tire Booster Schwalbe tubeless inflatorincl. mounting material","{""Volume"": ""1.15 litres"", ""Dimensions"": ""39.5 x 11 x 8 cm"", ""Booster Body Material"": ""Aluminium""}",2025-12-29 18:46:24,2025-12-29 18:46:24

It works with E-Tube Project Professional software for Microsoft Windows - the E-Tube Cyclist app is not supported. The unit is connected directly to a PC using the included micro USB to USB cable. On the other side, you connect it to any free e-tube connection on your bike via one of the two system cables, which are also included. It is also possible to connect individual components to SM-PCE02 without them being mounted on the bike. One of the system cables supplied is compatible with connectors of the (older) type EW-SD50, the other with connectors of the (newer) type EW-SD300. In contrast to the app, the Professional software with cable-supported connection offers you a large maintenance area. Here you can check the status of the drive unit and battery or the usage ratio for each gear setting for the front derailleur. You can also make direct adjustments to the gearing. You can also view the error log of the e-bike and select which Di2 or STEPS units you want to run error diagnostics. The result and much more information are part of the service report, which you can view as a PDF. Just as with the app, you can of course also use the SM-PCE02 hardware to update firmware for Di2 or STEPS parts, pair devices or adjust settings. In the case of electronic shifters and derailleurs, these are, for example, the button assignment on the STI, the shift mode or the multi-shift mode. For e-bikes, the riding characteristics, support patterns and support profiles can be configured or the display can be adjusted.

The selected range allows you to carry out repairs and assembly work on bicycles yourself. An empty bit check is particularly practical, as it can be individually stocked with tools for when you are on the move. This reduces weight on cycling tours. The mini ratchet allows you to work in all hard-to-reach places. Their low installation height is particularly advantageous in very tight installation situations. The fine-tooth mechanism with 60 teeth enables a small return angle of only 6°. This affords you the ability to work with high precision. In addition, the ratchet is reversible and has a knurled wheel for fast tightening. The enclosed bits and sockets can be used in both manual and machine operation. This means that you are equipped with only one socket / bit selection for almost all purposes. The high-quality bit handle has a Kraftform Plus handle that offers a pleasant ergonomic feel. Two composite tyre levers are also included, which you can use to lift the tyre safely without damaging the rim. compact 41-piece screwdriving tool set for bicycle applications, also for mobile usepractical assortment for the independent execution of common assembly work and repairsrobust, surface-friendly, compact textile bag with low weight"" Take it easy"" tool finder: colour coding by sizeRapidaptor bit holder with quick-release sleeve: fast bit change without auxiliary tools, even with small bit sizestwo multi-use tyre levers 05004172001 The Wera Bicycle Set 3 includes: 1 x Wera 8001 A ring ratchet (1/4"" x 87 mm)1 x Wera 813 bit holder (1/4"" x 78 mm)1 x Wera 889/4/1 K Rapidaptor universal holder (1/4"" x 50 mm)1 x Wera 870/1 tool shank (1/4"" x 25 mm)7 x Wera 8790 HMA socket wrench inserts (5.5 / 6 / 7 / 8 / 10 / 13 / 15 x 23 mm)3 x Wera 851/1 TZ PH bits (PH 1 / PH 2 / PH 3 x 25 mm)7 x Wera 867/1 TZ Torx bits (TX 10 / TX 15 / TX 20 / TX 25 / TX 27 / TX 30 / TX 40 x 25 mm)3 x Wera 800/1 TZ bits (0.5 x 4 / 0.6 x 4.5 / 1 x 5.5 x 25 mm)7 x Wera 840/1 Z Hex-Plus bits (2 / 2.5 / 3 / 4 / 5 / 6 / 8 x 25 mm)5 x Wera 842/1 Z bits ( 2.5 / 3 / 4 / 5 / 6 x 25 mm)1 x Wera 9502 tyre lever with bit attachment1 x Wera 9503 tyre lever with valve extractor1 x Wera bit check, empty1 x hook-and-loop strips 120 x 50 mm1 x Wera tool pouch",,2025-12-29 19:00:37,2025-12-29 19:00:37
