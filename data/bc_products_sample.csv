In addition to this high-quality technology, the IQ-X also has design: the housing, which also serves as a cooling system, is made of high-quality aluminium, available in silver or black. Slits in the mounting ring radiate brightly to the side, providing accents which also improve visibility, while the ergonomic operating button is embedded in a blue illuminated ring. This safety equipment is equipped as standard: a sensor-controlled daytime running light, standing light and a flexible multi-joint front light mount with an integrated cable duct, which also allows overhead installation. Information on the return and disposal of used batteries and electrical equipment can be found here . a flexible multi-joint headlamp holder with an integrated cable ductLED dynamo front lightsergonomic control buttonshigh-quality aluminium housingwith a switch for a hub dynamo IQ Technology The revolutionary light from busch+müller: a special reflector with an optimised cooling system uses a high-performance LED as an indirect light source. The LED is not visible any longer in the middle of the reflector. This creates a light field that is extremely evenly illuminated and can be twice as wide as conventional technology. Light effects can be positioned more precisely - for example, the near field in front of the front wheel can be additionally brightened. By the way: The standing light of the Lumotec headlights can run for many minutes. This is why the standing lights on Lumotec IQ models can also be switched off manually - so that no thief is tempted when the bicycle is parked. Automatic Sensor If a Lumotec front light has the addition of "" sensor"" in its name, it can switch on automatically at dusk or in the dark, and switches off automatically when driving in the light.

These are shifting aids and specially shaped sprocket teeth that make shifting to larger or smaller sprockets suppler, smoother and quieter. The system of small rivets attached to the side of the sprocket and milled or pressed-in ramps ensures that the chain is already carried along by the next sprocket during the shifting process before it leaves the previous sprocket. Hyperglide+ is optimised for faster shifting and shifting under load and has a more efficient chain connection, holding power and power transfer when combined with a compatible HG chain. Compared to Hyperglide, the shifting time is reduced by one third and the pedal stroke is noticeably reduced. HG+ enables a completely new chain stability and thus offers a safe riding experience. Micro Spline Micro Spline is an innovative tooth profile on MTB freehub bodies from Shimano. All Shimano 12-speed MTB cassettes with a 10-tooth sprocket are equipped with Micro Spline freehub toothing. The significantly higher and finer toothing enables a stiffer connection between the cassette and the hub body.

In contrast to the CS-R7100, it's compatible with both electronic and mechanical groupsets. With only about 15 grams more weight than the Ultegra model, it offers fast and smooth shifting, even when you pedal hard. It has the same width as an 11-speed cassette, so the sprockets are closer together. This accommodates the speed and smoothness of shifting. The smallest of the 12 steel sprockets has 11 teeth and the largest 34, which means a very wide range that lets you find the right gear uphill, downhill and on flat terrain. This way you can move forward efficiently everywhere and maintain your flow. Also worth noting: the freehub of the CS-R7101 cassette is not only compatible with Shimano 12-speed freehub bodies, but also with conventional road freehub bodies. fast and smooth gear changes even at high torquessame width as 11-speed cassette due to closer-spaced sprocketswide range for any terraincompatible with 12-speed and 11-speed road freehub bodiessuitable for electronic and mechanical groupsetsnickel-plated sprocket and lockringanodised spider HG cassette Shimano Hyperglide cassettes (HG cassettes) have strategically-positioned ramps and special tooth profiles so that the chain can be completely guided directly onto the next sprocket.

A completely new system to discover new horizons. This is Eagle. There is still much to discover. Designed to SRAM Eagle geometry, the GX Eagle chain features full pins, Eagle PowerLock® and offers smooth, efficient shifting you can rely on every ride. Before you replace components on your e-bike, please read through the guidelines for component replacement for CE-marked E-bikes/pedelecs with pedal assistance. Flow Link™: The ultra smooth inner plates of the chain are completely edge-free. This reduces friction on the cassette and chainring. The result: low-noise performance and longer component life. The chain design allows for a narrower profile. This way, the chain is much more torsion resistant. Due to their smooth outer flaps, the riveting is more uniform and the tensile strength is higher. PowerLock®: SRAM chain engineers developed PowerLock® as a tool-free, secure and consistent way to connect SRAM chains.

Eagle drivetrains chrome-plated inner plates with PVD coatingnickel-plated outer plates with PVD coatingFlow Link and Hard Chrome™ technologies for less wearcolour matching Eagle componentsquiet, light and durablestrong PowerLock master link Flow Link™: The ultra smooth inner plates of the chain are completely edge-free. This reduces friction on the cassette and chainring. The result: low-noise performance and longer component life. The chain design allows for a narrower profile. This way, the chain is much more torsion resistant. Due to their smooth outer flaps, the riveting is more uniform and the tensile strength is higher. Hard Chrome™: Chains with Hard Chrome have a four times higher (wear) resistance than other SRAM chains. This is due to the machining process for the inner links and rollers. The push-pin resistance and the overall resistance correspond to current SRAM chains. Chains with Hard Chrome last longer and are extremely stable. PowerLock™ SRAM have developed PowerLock as a tool-free, safe and consistent way to connect SRAM chains. Although the PowerLock master link does not require any special tools for assembly, each PowerLock can only be used once due to the narrow tolerance range of modern drivetrains. X-Sync™: Chains with X-Sync technology are perfectly matched for use with X-Sync chainrings. X-Sync chainrings by SRAM provide the highest performance and durability. The long X-Sync tooth edges grip the chain earlier than traditional triangular teeth. The sharp and narrow tooth profile and the rounded sloping edges support chain guiding: To provide the best possible performance even on muddy terrain, the X-Sync chainrings have indentations for the inner chain links and rollers to remove dirt and mud.

The goal was a chainring that increases the performance of the Eagle groupset under all operating conditions. The result: the chainring teeth are longer and shaped like a saw blade to perfectly engage the Eagle chain. The new chainring thus increases chain tension and efficiency when pedalling.

The goal was a chainring that increases the performance of the Eagle groupset under all operating conditions. The result: the chainring teeth are longer and shaped like a saw blade to perfectly engage the Eagle chain. The new chainring thus increases chain tension and efficiency when pedalling. At the same time, friction, chain noise and wear are reduced. In addition, with the "" polar grey"" variant, a chainring version in the new AXS design is now also available.

Test riders around the world have confirmed that this design brings unparalleled performance. The right side of the chainring tooth has a different shape than the left side. The right side transmits the power to the chain and the left side opens a free space for cleaning mud and dirt. Since the two sides have completely different functions, it makes sense to design them differently, true to the motto: extra reinforcement where you need it, less material where you don't. The right side of the Drop-Stop tooth is as wide as possible to distribute the load over a larger area, which also minimises wear. The left side of the Drop-Stop tooth helps to guide the chain, but it does not transmit any load. Therefore the left side is narrower than the chain roller. Wear is not an issue on this side, so Wolf Tooth was able to save material and create a better mud clearance channel.

ABEC 3 bearings from Enduro Bearings feature 10th-degree chrome steel balls that are twice as round as the industry standard, and manufactured to the highest standard. The treads are made of a 52100 carbon chrome steel alloy that is vacuum-generated and then hardened for extra strength and durability. A high-gloss polish ensures precision and low noise. MAX bearings are characterised by a 35 to 40 % higher load capacity than standard radial bearings. For 20 years Enduro Bearings has been manufacturing them specifically for use on mountain bike shocks. As its name indicates, MAX bearings are fitted with the maximum possible number of balls. The grooves in the races are deeper to accommodate the multiple lateral turning forces at the MTB rear pivot. MAX BO (Black Oxide) bearings receive an additional magnetite treatment and therefore have almost as high a corrosion resistance as stainless steel. The inner edge, which is wider than the outer edge, is characteristic of MAX-E bearings. This makes it possible to do without spacers. The stainless steel bearings from Enduro Bearings are based on bearing balls and running surfaces made of 440C stainless steel. This material ensures maximum corrosion resistance in critical applications and environments. Stainless steel has 20% less load capacity than the 52100 chrome steel alloy used in most other Enduro Bearings, but it is far superior in terms of rust resistance. Seals and CRC marine grease provide additional water resistance. If you live in a rainy area and/or you don't leave your bike in the rain, 440C stainless steel bearings are for you. They can also be useful for headsets, as drops of sweat may be a problem there.

This gives you access to information about your overall performance, cadence, torque efficiency, left-right balance and round pedalling. The accuracy of the total of 24 strain gauges is even higher than the previous model, with a deviation of only 1.5%. Thanks to Bluetooth and ANT+ radio protocol, there is broad compatibility with bike computers and similar devices. The lithium-ion battery is located in control unit on the crank spider, which you can easily recharge yourself. If it is completely full again after about 2.5 hours, it will last for at least 300 hours. By the way, the charging cable is the same as for your Dura-Ace Di2 shifter. You can also carry out firmware updates via the E-Tube Project. On the housing of the control unit, you will find an LED that signals the battery charge level and a button for easy zero calibration. Of course, the entire construction is waterproof and there is active temperature compensation, so you don't have to worry about the weather. You can attach the magnet for cadence measurement to the chainstay, seat tube or down tube using the included positioning tool. Apart from these special features, the FC-R9200-P is technically identical to the "" normal"" Dura-Ace crank. It converts your power into propulsion in a highly efficient manner, is characterised by an optimal stability/weight ratio thanks to the Hollowtech II design and inspires with precise, fast shifting processes. The crank arms are hollow-formed, which results in a significant weight saving. Except for the axle, all essential parts were made of lightweight metal. FC-R9200-P has an asymmetrical 4-arm bolt circle diameter of 110 mm. It produces a chainline of 44.5 mm and has a Q-factor of 148 mm.

It is based on an integration of the bottom bracket and the right crank arm and works with a 24 mm axle or bearing diameter, which has proven to be optimal in terms of stability. In many cases, the bearing cups are on the outside so that the load is better distributed. High-quality precision seals ensure a long service life. Second-Generation Power Meters Shimano second-generation power meters use an improved force vector analysis and are therefore more accurate than their predecessors. Both crank arms have 12 sensors each, which are mounted in such a way that the crank deformation can be compensated for and the acting forces can be identified. The right and left sides are connected via the battery located in the axle, ensuring accurate measurement on both sides. The built-in temperature compensation contributes to the precision. You can easily recharge the battery with the Di2 charging cable EW-EC300. The power meters have Bluetooth and ANT+ compatibility to communicate with bike computers and smartphones.

Due to the same component basis (screw connection), existing hubs can be retrofitted or converted with this splined system. When converting from screw-on to plug-in sprockets, please also order the Splined Carrier or, in special cases, Splined Carrier S. Rohloff offers a template to check for collisions between the frame strut and the sprocket. When using the plug-in sprocket system, the chain tensioner requires the long frame bolt . The use of a closed chain guard (Hebie etc.) must be checked individually for compatibility. Due to the extended number of teeth, many chainring / sprocket combinations are possible. The permissible or desired transmission ratio can be determined with the Gears-Meters Table . In practice, a gear ratio (chainring: sprocket) of 2.5 - 2.8 has been proven to be suitable for touring/everyday use.

You love to escape from the stress and hectic goings-on of daily life. It's good that the Rohloff gears on your bike support you in this. This is because the Speedhub gearbox makes cycling very easy. Don't worry about whether the right gear is engaged, just turn the gear lever - even when stationary. With a twist, you can shift into any of the 14 gears. In addition, the Speedhub is extremely low-maintenance. Experience gears that requires minimal maintenance. One quick oil change a year, that's all it takes. After that, it's just a matter of keeping an eye on the chain, chainring and rear sprocket. No comparison to conventional multiple derailleurs and their sensitive rear derailleurs. Rohloff wants you to ride, not wait. The legendary Rohloff quality also includes the price-performance ratio of the gearbox. It is amazingly durable and also incurs minimal costs for its functionality. Enjoy an investment that pays off; because with every kilometre ridden, the cost balance improves compared to all other current derailleurs. The Speedhub is so robust that it has even been certified to run more than 300,000 kilometres. One of the most important reasons why the best touring cyclists in the world swear by the Speedhub. There is hardly a spot on earth, no matter how exotic, where the Rohloff gear hub has not been seen. Thanks to the Rohloff modular system, many different hub variants are created.

PowerGlide II: A cassette technology developed for off-road riding. More reliable, more durable and more powerful - SRAM cassettes are optimised by their tooth profile and climbing aids for precise and smooth gear changes. That way you can climb every mountain effortlessly. Flow Link™: The ultra smooth inner plates of the chain are completely edge-free. This reduces friction on the cassette and chainring. The result: low-noise performance and longer component life. The chain design allows for a narrower profile. This way, the chain is much more torsion resistant. Due to their smooth outer flaps, the riveting is more uniform and the tensile strength is higher. Hard Chrome™: Chains with Hard Chrome have a four times higher (wear) resistance than other SRAM chains. This is due to the machining process for the inner links and rollers. The push-pin resistance and the overall resistance correspond to current SRAM chains. Chains with Hard Chrome last longer and are extremely stable. PowerLock™: SRAM have developed PowerLock as a tool-free, safe and consistent way to connect SRAM chains. Although the PowerLock master link does not require any special tools for assembly, each PowerLock can only be used once due to the narrow tolerance range of modern drivetrains.

X-Dome™: X-Dome technology creates an incredibly lightweight, accurate and durable cassette. The open design repels dirt better and gives you smoother switching performance and longer component life. X-Glide 2™: The X-Glide 2 is the next generation of X-Glide technology. It has been specially optimised for the Eagle 12-speed cassette - for fast and precise shifting performance in all gears. X-Glide technology increases chain tension on the larger sprockets. Flow Link™: The ultra smooth inner plates of the chain are completely edge-free. This reduces friction on the cassette and chainring. The result: low-noise performance and longer component life. The chain design allows for a narrower profile. This way, the chain is much more torsion resistant. Due to their smooth outer flaps, the riveting is more uniform and the tensile strength is higher. Hard Chrome™: Chains with Hard Chrome have a four times higher (wear) resistance than other SRAM chains. This is due to the machining process for the inner links and rollers. The push-pin resistance and the overall resistance correspond to current SRAM chains. Chains with Hard Chrome last longer and are extremely stable. PowerLock™: SRAM have developed PowerLock as a tool-free, safe and consistent way to connect SRAM chains. Although the PowerLock master link does not require any special tools for assembly, each PowerLock can only be used once due to the narrow tolerance range of modern drivetrains. X-Sync™: Chains with X-Sync technology are perfectly matched for use with X-Sync chainrings. X-Sync chainrings by SRAM provide the highest performance and durability. The long X-Sync tooth edges grip the chain earlier than traditional triangular teeth. The sharp and narrow tooth profile and the rounded sloping edges support chain guiding: To provide the best possible performance even on muddy terrain, the X-Sync chainrings have indentations for the inner chain links and rollers to remove dirt and mud.

These are characterised by Hyperglide+ technology, which ensures seamless shifting even under heavy load. You can even change gears safely and instantly when pedalling or sprinting. The gradations have been selected to ensure high gear efficiency in all situations as well as optimal acceleration. The enlarged teeth of the pinions also contribute to this. A special plus point is its compatibility: CS-R9200 not only fits on the new 12-speed freehub body, but can also be used with conventional Shimano road freehub bodies. Depending on the gradation, five or six sprockets are made of titanium, resulting in a clear weight advantage. The Shimano CN-M9100 chain has already been put through its paces in the MTB sector and is also a central component of the Dura-Ace R9200 groupset. It has enlarged inner links and thus contributes significantly to smooth shifting performance. Thanks to HG technology, vibrations are avoided, chain hold is improved and pedalling efficiency is increased. The SIL-TEC coating of the outer plates and rollers ensures smoother, low-wear running.

The sprocket carrier made of aluminium and the nine sprockets made of steel impress with perfect stiffness. Nevertheless, the cassette is so light that it does not become noticeable as annoying dead weight on long tours. Those who prefer shorter distances will also be able to benefit from the CS-M770, because Shimano has designed its XT series for the needs of different types of riders. The blasted chrome finish provides a certain shiny effect. Of course, this cassette also features the Hyperglide (HG) sprocket design, which helps to move the chain smoothly and optimally from one sprocket to the other. The Shimano CN-HG93 9-speed chain is super slim, manufactured with high precision and glides smoothly from one tooth to the other thanks to Hyperglide (HG) technology.

You can choose between different colour combinations. The SRAM XG-1299 cassette with 12 gears for XX1 Eagle has a special, extremel durable finish and is light, stable and durable. With the different colour options, aesthetes who want to perfectly match the colour of their bike will also get their money's worth. Its X-Dome™ construction makes it extremely torsion-resistant, while the shifting process is quiet and smooth. With a possible 10-52 teeth, the XG-1299 has an enormous range for you, with which you don't have to step off the bike, even in the steepest climbs. Or would you like to switch to a larger chainring and reach higher speeds without sacrificing climbing ability? You have all the options! The SRAM PC XX1 chain is made for Eagle 12-speed drives and stands out on your mountain bike with a light, durable design and different color options. Hollow pins make the chain light, while Flow Link™ technology with smooth, flat link plates ensures precise, smooth shifting and silent operation. The chain is uncompromisingly strong without any loss of performance and extremely wear-resistant. Even aesthetes get their money's worth thanks to the colour selection matched to Eagle components.

X-Dome™: X-Dome technology creates an incredibly lightweight, accurate and durable cassette. The open design repels dirt better and gives you smoother switching performance and longer component life. X-Glide 2™: The X-Glide 2 is the next generation of X-Glide technology. It has been specially optimised for the Eagle 12-speed cassette - for fast and precise shifting performance in all gears. X-Glide technology increases chain tension on the larger sprockets. Flow Link™: The ultra smooth inner plates of the chain are completely edge-free. This reduces friction on the cassette and chainring. The result: low-noise performance and longer component life. The chain design allows for a narrower profile. This way, the chain is much more torsion resistant. Due to their smooth outer flaps, the riveting is more uniform and the tensile strength is higher. Hard Chrome™: Chains with Hard Chrome have a four times higher (wear) resistance than other SRAM chains. This is due to the machining process for the inner links and rollers. The push-pin resistance and the overall resistance correspond to current SRAM chains. Chains with Hard Chrome last longer and are extremely stable. PowerLock™ SRAM have developed PowerLock as a tool-free, safe and consistent way to connect SRAM chains. Although the PowerLock master link does not require any special tools for assembly, each PowerLock can only be used once due to the narrow tolerance range of modern drivetrains. X-Sync™: Chains with X-Sync technology are perfectly matched for use with X-Sync chainrings. X-Sync chainrings by SRAM provide the highest performance and durability. The long X-Sync tooth edges grip the chain earlier than traditional triangular teeth. The sharp and narrow tooth profile and the rounded sloping edges support chain guiding: To provide the best possible performance even on muddy terrain, the X-Sync chainrings have indentations for the inner chain links and rollers to remove dirt and mud. 10-50: 10-52: 1 x SRAM XG-1299 cassette1 x SRAM PC XX1 Eagle chain1 x SRAM PowerLock master link","{""Application"": ""Cross Country, All Mountain"", ""Gearing"": ""12-speed"", ""Freehub Compatibility"": ""SRAM XD"", ""Series"": ""XX1 Eagle"", ""Sprocket Material"": ""steel (sprockets 1 - 11), aluminium (sprocket 12)"", ""Gradation"": ""10-12-14-16-18-21-24-28-32-36-42-52 T"", ""Number of Links"": ""126"", ""Closure Type"": ""PowerLock™ FlowLink™"", ""Pin Type"": ""hollow pins"", ""Directional"": ""no (chain), yes (master link)"", ""Material"": ""steel"", ""rainbow"": ""coloured"", ""copper"": ""copper red"", ""Manufacturer Numbers"": ""00.2418.107.002 (rainbow), 00.2418.107.000 (copper), 00.2418.107.001 (gold) + 00.2518.039.010 (XX1 rainbow), 00.2518.043.010 (XX1 copper), 00.2518.024.020 (XX1 gold), 00.2518.024.021 (XX1 black)""}",2025-12-25 15:44:33,2025-12-27 13:41:51

Due to its robustness, it is also suited for e-bikes. The smallest sprockets are manufactured in one piece as a mini cluster, the remaining sprockets are assembled in a pindome design. Compared to Eagle cassettes, the gear gradation of the largest sprockets is more even. The X-Sync design enables outstanding shifting performance even and especially under full load. Thanks to cassette mapping, the gear changes take place along designated shift ramps, which makes the process extremely smooth. With a chainline of 55 mm, the lower chain angle is noticeable, which reduces wear and increases precision. The cassette can only be used together with an Eagle Transmission rear derailleur, with which it opens up an ideal shifting experience. As an assembly aid, the setup sprocket that you need for the correct adjustment of the rear derailleur is highlighted in colour. Before you replace components on your e-bike, please read through the guidelines for component replacement for CE-marked e-bikes/pedelecs with pedal assistance. only compatible withEagle Transmission rear derailleurs robust, inexpensive 12-speed cassette for an electronic mountain bike drivetrainlargest sprocket made of aluminium, others made of steelsmallest sprockets as one-piece mini cluster, others in pindome designexcellent shifting performance under full load thanks to X-Sync designmore consistent gear sequence than Eagle with regard to the largest three sprocketsin conjunction with 55 mm chainline, more moderate chain angle, thus higher resistance and precisionforms a functional unit with Eagle Transmission rear derailleursetup sprocket colour-coded for correct derailleur settingcassette mapping for smooth shifting along designated shift rampsalso suitable for e-bikes MINI CLUSTER™ MINI CLUSTER refers to a hybrid construction resulting in a light and strong cassette: The smallest sprockets are CNC-machined from a single block of steel, while the other sprockets are assembled with pins.

ABEC 3 bearings from Enduro Bearings feature 10th-degree chrome steel balls that are twice as round as the industry standard, and manufactured to the highest standard. The treads are made of a 52100 carbon chrome steel alloy that is vacuum-generated and then hardened for extra strength and durability. A high-gloss polish ensures precision and low noise. MAX bearings are characterised by a 35 to 40 % higher load capacity than standard radial bearings. For 20 years Enduro Bearings has been manufacturing them specifically for use on mountain bike shocks. As its name indicates, MAX bearings are fitted with the maximum possible number of balls. The grooves in the races are deeper to accommodate the multiple lateral turning forces at the MTB rear pivot. The stainless steel bearings from Enduro Bearings are based on bearing balls and running surfaces made of 440C stainless steel. This material ensures maximum corrosion resistance in critical applications and environments. Stainless steel has 20% less load capacity than the 52100 chrome steel alloy used in most other Enduro Bearings, but it is far superior in terms of rust resistance. Seals and CRC marine grease provide additional water resistance. If you live in a rainy area and/or you don't leave your bike in the rain, 440C stainless steel bearings are for you.
