In contrast to the CS-R8100, it is compatible with both electronic and mechanical groupsets. It features Hyperglide+ technology, which was first tested in the MTB sector and ensures seamless shifting even under heavy load. Even when you are riding out of the saddle or sprinting, you can shift safely and immediately. The gradations have been selected to ensure high gear efficiency in all situations as well as optimal acceleration. The enlarged teeth of the pinions also contribute to this. A special plus point is its compatibility: CS-R8101 not only fits on the special 12-speed freehub body, but can also be used with conventional Shimano road freehub bodies. All sprockets are made of steel, with two lightweight aluminium sprocket carriers.

These are shifting aids and specially shaped sprocket teeth that make shifting to larger or smaller sprockets suppler, smoother and quieter. The system of small rivets attached to the side of the sprocket and milled or pressed-in ramps ensures that the chain is already carried along by the next sprocket during the shifting process before it leaves the previous sprocket. Hyperglide+ is optimised for faster shifting and shifting under load and has a more efficient chain connection, holding power and power transfer when combined with a compatible HG chain. Compared to Hyperglide, the shifting time is reduced by one third and the pedal stroke is noticeably reduced. HG+ enables a completely new chain stability and thus offers a safe riding experience.

If you are looking for the lowest possible amount of gear steps, then the 10-45 tooth version is a good pick. If you want to cover as much bandwidth as possible, then opt for the 10-51 tooth version. Of course, all CS-M8100-12 cassettes feature Shimano Hyperglide+ technology for high shifting speed, precision and ease in up-/down-shifting. This has the added benefit of minimising noise. The spider as well as the two largest sprockets are made of aluminium, which contributes to weight reduction, robustness and durability. Guidelines for Replacing E-bike Components: Before you replace components on your e-bike, please read through the guidelines for component replacement for CE-marked e-bikes/pedelecs with pedal assistance.

These are shifting aids and specially shaped sprocket teeth that make shifting to larger or smaller sprockets suppler, smoother and quieter. The system of small rivets attached to the side of the sprocket and milled or pressed-in ramps ensures that the chain is already carried along by the next sprocket during the shifting process before it leaves the previous sprocket. Hyperglide+ is optimised for faster shifting and shifting under load and has a more efficient chain connection, holding power and power transfer when combined with a compatible HG chain. Compared to Hyperglide, the shifting time is reduced by one third and the pedal stroke is noticeably reduced. HG+ enables a completely new chain stability and thus offers a safe riding experience. Micro Spline Micro Spline is an innovative tooth profile on MTB freehub bodies from Shimano. All Shimano 12-speed MTB cassettes with a 10-tooth sprocket are equipped with Micro Spline freehub toothing. The significantly higher and finer toothing enables a stiffer connection between the cassette and the hub body. The resulting increased contact area ensures reliable power transmission, minimises wear and prevents deformation of the freehub and sprocket.

The SRAM AXS app allows you to view battery status, change component behaviour, adjust controls, receive maintenance reminders and update firmware. X-Range™: The X-Range technology was developed with the possibilities of today's dropbar bikes in mind. It is distinguished by a wide gear range with smooth, even gear changes. The combination of chainrings with 13-tooth spacing with a high bandwidth cassette, starting with a 10-tooth sprocket, ensures well thought-out, homogeneous gear jumps and always puts you in the right gear. In combination with AXS, you can make various shift settings and personalise your drivetrain to suit you. MINI CLUSTER™: MINI CLUSTER refers to a hybrid construction resulting in a light and strong cassette: The smallest sprockets are CNC-machined from a single block of steel, while the other sprockets are assembled with pins. This saves weight and ensures fast, precise shifting.

In contrast to the CS-R7100, it's compatible with both electronic and mechanical groupsets. With only about 15 grams more weight than the Ultegra model, it offers fast and smooth shifting, even when you pedal hard. It has the same width as an 11-speed cassette, so the sprockets are closer together. This accommodates the speed and smoothness of shifting. The smallest of the 12 steel sprockets has 11 teeth and the largest 34, which means a very wide range that lets you find the right gear uphill, downhill and on flat terrain. This way you can move forward efficiently everywhere and maintain your flow. Also worth noting: the freehub of the CS-R7101 cassette is not only compatible with Shimano 12-speed freehub bodies, but also with conventional road freehub bodies.

Hollow pins make the chain light, while Flow Link™ technology with smooth, flat link plates ensure precise, smooth shifting and almost silent operation. The chain is uncompromisingly strong without any loss of performance and extremely wear-resistant. Even aesthetes get their money's worth thanks to the colour selection matched to Eagle components. Guidelines for Replacing E-bike Components: Before you replace components on your e-bike, please read through the guidelines for component replacement for CE-marked e-bikes/pedelecs with pedal assistance.

This reduces friction on the cassette and chainring. The result: low-noise performance and longer component life. The chain design allows for a narrower profile. This way, the chain is much more torsion resistant. Due to their smooth outer flaps, the riveting is more uniform and the tensile strength is higher. Hard Chrome™: Chains with Hard Chrome have a four times higher (wear) resistance than other SRAM chains. This is due to the machining process for the inner links and rollers. The push-pin resistance and the overall resistance correspond to current SRAM chains. Chains with Hard Chrome last longer and are extremely stable. PowerLock™ SRAM have developed PowerLock as a tool-free, safe and consistent way to connect SRAM chains. Although the PowerLock master link does not require any special tools for assembly, each PowerLock can only be used once due to the narrow tolerance range of modern drivetrains. X-Sync™: Chains with X-Sync technology are perfectly matched for use with X-Sync chainrings. X-Sync chainrings by SRAM provide the highest performance and durability. The long X-Sync tooth edges grip the chain earlier than traditional triangular teeth. The sharp and narrow tooth profile and the rounded sloping edges support chain guiding: To provide the best possible performance even on muddy terrain, the X-Sync chainrings have indentations for the inner chain links and rollers to remove dirt and mud. Note: The colour of the PowerLock master link does not match the chain colour.
