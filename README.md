## About Daiy

An startup that aims to help every DIYler to find the right parts and tools using multimodal AI.

## Daiy PoC

This repository currently contains the attempt to set up a standalone proof of concept (PoC) for Daiy including a product database, an API caller to exchange requests with AI models, and a simple web interface to demonstrate the functionality.

## Setup

## Sample Data and Database

Based on sample data from 99 Spokes (and potentially other sources like Home Depot product data from Kaggle or Googles sample product data), a simple product database is created using PostgreSQL. The database schema is defined in the `database/schema.sql` file, and sample data can be found in the `database/sample_data/` directory.
